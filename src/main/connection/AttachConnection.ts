// Transport for ATTACHING to an already-running, detachable Lich session —
// one started as `lich --login Char --headless PORT` (which Lich normalizes
// to `--without-frontend --detachable-client=PORT`) or with an explicit
// `--detachable-client=` flag.
//
// The protocol is deliberately nothing. Lich's detachable listener accepts a
// plain TCP connection with NO authentication and NO handshake (verified in
// lich-5: main.rb's detachable_client_thread accepts the socket and hands it
// straight to global_defs.rb handle_detachable_client, whose read loop treats
// every line we send as typed client input). On accept, Lich pushes a
// Stormfront-XML state resync — vitals progressBars, prepared spell, status
// indicators, compass (detachable_client_send_init) — then the live stream.
// Multiple front-ends may be attached at once; a detachable client dropping
// does NOT end the session (docs/runtime-io.md).
//
// Three things this transport must NOT do, each the opposite of
// LichConnection's launch-and-handshake shape:
//   1. NO SGE login key. Headless Lich logged in by itself from its saved
//      entries; a key written here would be dispatched to the game as a
//      nonsense command.
//   2. NO FE:WRAYTH client-ID line, for the same reason.
//   3. NO QUIT on close. From an attached client, Lich routes a user-exit
//      command through UserExitDispatch.dispatch_detachable_client — a full
//      orderly shutdown of the whole session, the exact opposite of
//      detaching. Closing the socket IS the detach: the character stays in
//      game and scripts keep running. (A player who WANTS to log out can
//      still type `exit` themselves — that reaching Lich as a real exit is
//      correct.)
//
// Kept free of electron imports on purpose: unlike LichConnection there is no
// child process to spawn and no userData log dir to resolve, and staying
// dependency-free lets the protocol be exercised by a plain-node harness
// against a fake listener.
