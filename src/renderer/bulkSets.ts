// Named Bulk Connect sets (F85, v0.18.3 — Binu).
//
// Bulk Connect logged in one character from EVERY saved account, with no way to
// leave an account out. Binu: *"let's say I want to spend the day farming, I
// have a set named farm that logs in my best farming character from whichever
// accounts I want"* — so a set is a named TEAM, not a named account.
//
// A set stores CHARACTER NAMES. The account is derivable from the character
// (and a character can move accounts about as often as never), so storing names
// keeps a set meaningful even if the picker's grouping changes. Names that no
// longer exist are dropped at LOAD time rather than pruned on disk — a set that
// mentions an archived character should come back intact if that character is
// restored (F79 archives rather than deletes).
//
// APP-WIDE: a set spans accounts by definition, so it cannot live in a
// character profile. Rides `SharedProfile.bulkSets` → `_shared.yaml` with the
// three registrations Principle #1 requires.
