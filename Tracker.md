**Stream Timestamps — Per-stream [HH:MM] toggle via right-click context menu ✅**
**Packaging & Auto-Update — Portable exe via electron-builder, GitHub Releases, electron-updater ✅**
**Auto-Update UX — Dismissable banner, Check for Updates button, "You're up to date" feedback ✅**
**Auto-Updater Fix — `app-update.yml` bundled as extraResource; was missing from portable builds causing silent failure ✅**
**Artifact Name Fix — `artifactName` uses hyphens; matches GitHub asset URL so download works correctly ✅**
**Release Folder Cleanup — `publish.mjs` deletes old exes/ymls before each build; prevents stale file pickup ✅**
**Version Display — Version shown on login screen and in window title bar ✅**
**Application Menu — File/Edit/View/Window menu; File → Open Data Folder ✅**
**DevTools — Closed by default in packaged builds; accessible via View menu ✅**
**Release Notes — `publish.mjs` injects `release-notes.md` via GitHub REST API PATCH after build ✅**
**Release Pipeline — `publish.mjs` runs `npm run build` first so version is always baked in correctly ✅**
**`latest.yml` — generated manually in `publish.mjs` via SHA-512 hash of the exe; electron-builder does not produce it for portable builds ✅**
**Login Screen — card height stabilized; no more resize while connection log scrolls ✅**
**Lich Path Auto-Detect — ↺ button scans C:\Ruby4Lich5 for Ruby version folders and Lich5; ✓/✕ icons per path; status message for partial/missing/no-folder cases; Windows only ✅**
**Direct Connection — Advanced panel shows message instead of empty box when Lich is unchecked ✅**
**Disconnect Handling — clean disconnect tracked in main process (`cleanDisconnect` flag); set by: `quit`/`exit` command sent (Lich path), Disconnect button IPC, or `<exit/>` XML tag (direct path); `clean` bool passed in status payload — no cross-channel race; debug panel no longer auto-opens on intentional disconnects (B11 partial fix ✅)**
**Toolbar & Title Polish — disconnected status in accent color; window title uses pipe separator; title tracks connection state: `DR [Not connected]` → `CharName · GAME [Connected]` → `CharName · GAME [Disconnected]`; "Connection closed." injected into main text on disconnect with blank line above and timestamp ✅**
**Debug Panel — B11: `autoFocus` on command input prevents debug button stealing focus at startup ✅; B12: tab-switch `useEffect` scrolls Raw XML to bottom on first open ✅; F06: Copy All button (toolbar + right-click) copies active tab content to clipboard; raw XML lines trimmed before join to prevent blank lines in pasted output ✅; F09: `showDebugRef` gates `setDebugEvents` and `setRawXmlLines` — no re-renders from debug collection while panel is closed ✅; B14: Events tab scroll lock fixed — stable `key={eventBaseRef+i}` prevents content shifts when buffer rolls over ✅**
**Exp Panel — F10: rank-gain detection via `CaptureContext.hasBold` in parser; `rankUpSkills` state + 3s timers in GameWindow; skill rows bold for 3s on rank gain ✅; F11: Death's Sting badge in footer — detected from second `exp rexp` component overwriting first in same batch; red italic badge; RXP data hidden while active ✅; B15: RXP usable regex updated to handle both `minutes` and `hours` formats; ExpBrief sends empty rexp component — RXP row correctly hidden ✅**
**Settings — System Font Picker ✅: inline scrollable font list replaces 4-preset dropdown; Local Font Access API via `queryLocalFonts()`; Electron `setPermissionRequestHandler` + `setPermissionCheckHandler` required for full enumeration; monospace filter via canvas width test; font family auto-scrolls to selected entry on open; defaults: Consolas 12px Compact; legacy preset keys migrated transparently on first open ✅**
**Graceful Close ✅: clicking the window X, File → Quit, or Window → Close now sends QUIT to the game server before the window closes; `mainWindow.on('close')` intercepts the event, sets `cleanDisconnect`, calls `gracefulDisconnect()` (5s timeout), then calls `destroy()`; only triggers when `connected = true` so login screen closes instantly; all OS-level close paths covered by the single `close` event handler; `connected` set to `false` immediately on close to prevent double-trigger if X is clicked twice ✅**
**Font panel CSS bug fixes ✅: fixed em-compounding in `.exp-chevron` (nested inside `.exp-group-header`) and `.exp-footer-label` (nested inside `.exp-footer-row`) — corrected em values to account for parent's scaled font-size; fixed `.room-panel--empty` font-size being overridden by CSS cascade when both `.room-panel` and `.room-panel--empty` classes are on the same element — removed explicit font-size from `.room-panel--empty` so it inherits correctly from the container ✅**
**Settings — Font propagation to all panels ✅: `--game-font-size` and `--game-line-height` CSS vars now anchor on `.stream-panel`, `.room-panel`, `.exp-panel`, `.injuries-panel`, `.panel-frame-tabs`, and `.game-toolbar`; structured panel children converted from `rem` → `em` so proportions are preserved at default 12px and scale with the slider; panel tab labels, toolbar buttons, toolbar title, and status text also scale; font family was already global via `body` inheritance ✅**
**B17 — Combat scroll-pin race ✅: `onWheel` on the text window sets `pinnedRef = false` immediately when user scrolls up (synchronous, fires before DOM scroll); prevents `useLayoutEffect` from re-pinning in the same frame when combat lines are arriving very fast; also added `pinnedRef = false` to `PageUp`/`Home` keyboard handlers which had the same gap ✅**
**B20 — Scroll pin breaks after ~2000 new lines ✅: root cause is `overflow-anchor: none` on `.text-window` — trimming lines from the top while scrolled up doesn't adjust `scrollTop`, so the view drifts forward toward newer content each trim cycle. Fix: don't trim while unpinned; lines append freely; badge/End re-pins and trims to MAX_LINES; hard cap at 6000 auto-resumes. Also removed `dist < 2` re-pin from `handleScroll` (only un-pins now) and stale-true guard on pre-`setLines` DOM check. Tested stable at 3600+ new lines. ✅**
**B19 — Home/End in automation text fields ✅: document `onKeyDown` scroll handler was intercepting Home/End for all elements except the command input; added `HTMLInputElement`/`HTMLTextAreaElement` guard so the scroll-key handler is skipped whenever any text field has focus ✅**
**B18 — Auto-copy restored via native clipboard IPC ✅: `navigator.clipboard.writeText` silently failed due to permission handler added for font picker in v0.1.9; even with `clipboard-write` whitelisted Electron's internal name didn't match; replaced with Electron native `clipboard.writeText` via `write-clipboard` IPC channel — synchronous, no permissions needed; `setPermissionCheckHandler` simplified to `() => true` ✅**
**Map System Polish Pass ✅: B22–B27 internal bug fixes (LabelMode at module scope; unused currentRoomId prop removed throughout; computeFit center recalculated correctly when scale is clamped; indexing counter now reactive via indexedCount state; loadZone cancels active walk on zone switch; empty arc.move guarded in exit click and BFS); stale map path handling — list-map-dir returns null for missing directory (silently clears stored path), loadZone silently resets on missing file; Location Unknown strip shown above canvas when player is in a room with no node match; official 16-color room legend wired up (COLOR_LEGEND constant) — legend panel shows name + description for known colors, unknown colors still render on map but are hidden from the legend panel ✅**
**B29 — Hide Lich Window ✅: Electron is a GUI process with no console — direct spawn with windowsHide:false produced no visible window as there was no parent console to inherit. Fix: hidden path keeps direct spawn with windowsHide:true; visible path uses shell:true to route through cmd.exe which creates its own console window for Lich output ✅**
**Map Panel UI Reorganization ✅: Two-bar chrome layout — top toolbar is file management only (folder, refresh, zone select, search); bottom bar holds all navigation and view controls (◆ center, room ID badge, z-level chips, Labels dropdown, ⊡ fit, ▤ legend, ■ stop-walk); color legend converted from flex child to absolute overlay inside canvas wrap so it never squeezes the map in compact panel sizes; current room label deferred to end of nodeLabels array so it always paints on top of neighboring labels ✅**
**Map Theming ✅: Map panel fully theme-aware via 18 CSS custom properties (--map-bg, --map-chrome-bg, --map-border, --map-border-subtle, --map-text, --map-text-muted, --map-btn-bg, --map-btn-border, --map-select-bg, --map-select-color, --map-node-fill, --map-node-stroke, --map-arc-cardinal, --map-arc-vertical, --map-arc-special, --map-arc-hidden, --map-dot, --map-current-color). All 18 built-in themes have per-theme overrides. XML-defined node colors are never overridden. Current room indicator (pulse ring, crosshair, label) resolves from --map-current-color. arcColor() returns var() strings so arc colors update live on theme switch. applyCustomTheme() now merges over darkBase before applying, so pre-existing custom themes automatically receive correct map defaults without needing to be rebuilt ✅**

- [x] Game window (raw text display, XML stripped, command bar, disconnect button)
- [x] Graceful disconnect (QUIT → wait for server close → force close)

---

## Phase 2 — XML Parsing & Core UI

Broken into 5 testable milestones. Build and test each before moving to the next.

### Milestone 2A — Parser & IPC Foundation
> Goal: typed events flow through IPC, main text still works, debug panel shows event stream

- [x] StormFront XML parser (SAX-style: tag_start / text / tag_end callbacks, active tag stack)
- [x] Typed GameEvent types (VitalUpdate, RoundtimeEvent, IndicatorEvent, StreamText, RoomComponent, ExpComponent, etc.)
- [x] Main process emits typed GameEvent array over IPC instead of raw strings
- [x] Renderer handles typed events — main text still renders correctly
- [x] Debug panel — shows raw parsed event stream in real time (toggle via "Debug" button in toolbar)
- **Test:** Connect to game → main text works → debug panel shows typed events

#### Parser Implementation Notes (from Lich xmlparser.rb — Binu's recommendation)

Reference file: `C:\Ruby4Lich5\Lich5\lib\common\xmlparser.rb`

Lich uses Ruby's REXML StreamListener — a SAX-style parser with three callbacks:
- `tag_start(name, attributes)` — opening or self-closing tag
- `text(text_string)` — text content between tags
- `tag_end(name)` — closing tag

Model our TypeScript parser the same way: maintain an **active tag stack** and **active ID stack**, then dispatch based on the current tag context. This handles mixed text+XML naturally — text content arrives as a separate callback, not mixed into the tag handling.

**Vital bars — `<progressBar>` ids and text format:**

| `id` attribute | What it tracks | Text format |
|---|---|---|
| `health` | Health | `value` is 0-100 percentage. `text` is display string e.g. `"HEALTH 100%"` — use `value` directly |
| `mana` | Mana | same — `value` is 0-100 percentage |
| `spirit` | Spirit | same — `value` is 0-100 percentage |
| `stamina` | Fatigue | same — `value` is 0-100 percentage |
| `concentration` | Concentration | same — `value` is 0-100 percentage. Tag arrives as `conclevel` |
| `pbarStance` | Stance | `"Standing 100"` — first word is stance text |
| `conclevel` | Concentration (alias) | DR sends `conclevel` not `concentration` — normalize to `concentration` on ingest |
| `encumlevel` | Encumbrance | text is encumbrance label, value is 0-110 |
| `nextLvlPB` | XP toward next level | value = percent, text = label |

The text attribute is **not** just the current value — it contains `"current max"` as two integers. Use `.scan(/-?\d+/)` equivalent to extract both numbers.

**Room title in DR:**
- Comes from `<streamWindow id='main' subtitle=' - [Bosque Deriel, Hermit\'s Shacks] (230008)'/>` — NOT from a component tag
- Parse with regex: extract `[Room Name]` from subtitle, and the trailing `(uid)` as room ID
- Example: ` - [Bosque Deriel, Hermit's Shacks] (230008)` → title: `Bosque Deriel, Hermit's Shacks`, roomId: `230008`

**Room component IDs (use exactly these strings):**
- `room objs` — objects/NPCs in room (NOT `room objects`)
- `room players` — players in room
- `room exits` — exits (text of `<d>` child tags = individual exit directions)
- `room desc` — room description prose

**Stance:**
- Comes from `<progressBar id="pbarStance" text="Standing" value="100"/>` — NOT from an `<indicator>` tag
- First word of `text` attribute is the stance label

**`nav` tag — room change signal:**
- `<nav/>` fires before new room data arrives
- Signals: clear current room panel (NPCs, loot, players, description)
- In DR, room ID comes from the `streamWindow` subtitle, not `nav` attributes

**`prompt` tag — server time:**
- `<prompt time="1714512345">` carries the server's Unix timestamp
- Useful for accurate RT calculation: `rtExpiry - serverTime + Date.now()` corrects for clock drift

**Indicator IDs are stored with `Icon` prefix:**
- Raw format: `IconSTUNNED`, `IconBLEEDING`, `IconWEBBED`, `IconHIDDEN`, `IconDEAD`, `IconPOISONED`, `IconDISEASED`
- Normalize on ingest: strip `Icon` prefix, lowercase → `stunned`, `bleeding`, etc.

**`compDef` tag:** treated identically to `component` — handle both the same way.

**`spell` tag:** text content (between `<spell>` and `</spell>`) is the prepared spell name. `"None"` means nothing prepared.

**`right` / `left` tags:** text content is the held item name. `"Empty"` means nothing held.

**`pushBold` / `popBold`:** toggle bold state — tracked as a depth counter (nested bold is possible).

**Active spells (percWindow stream):** complex text parsing of spell names + durations. Defer to a later milestone — do not attempt in 2A.

### Milestone 2B — Vitals Bar Strip ✅
> Goal: vitals, roundtime, indicators, prepared spell all live and updating

- [x] Fixed vitals bar strip at top of layout (flexbox column, between toolbar and main text)
- [x] Vital bars — Health, Mana, Concentration, Fatigue, Spirit (from VitalUpdate)
- [x] Vital bar gradient fills + 4-state health thresholds (green/yellow/orange/red at 80/50/30%)
- [x] Roundtime countdown — precise timer from Unix timestamp, scales to actual RT max
- [x] Cast time countdown — precise timer from Unix timestamp, scales to actual CT max
- [x] RT/CT persistent draining strips at bottom of icon bar (idle-dimmed when inactive)
- [x] Indicators — stance, bleeding, webbed, stunned, hidden, invisible, dead, joined
- [x] Stance from `<indicator>` tags now correctly emits StanceEvent (bug fix)
- [x] Prepared spell display
- [x] Two-row icon bar HUD (Section 4.8): stance/status row + compass/hands/spell row
- [x] Compass exits from `<component id='room exits'>` — tagEnd mismatch bug fixed
- [x] Left/right hand items from `<right>` / `<left>` tags
- [x] Command history — Up/Down arrow, 200-command buffer
- [x] Login screen status log auto-scrolls to bottom
- **Test:** ✅ Log in → bars appear → take damage → health drops → cast spell → RT counts down

#### Implementation Notes

- `VitalsBar.tsx` + `vitalsbar.css` — vitals only, gradient fills, threshold colors
- `IconBar.tsx` + `iconbar.css` — two-row HUD, all character/world state indicators
- Countdown interval runs at 100ms; `rtMaxRef` captures initial duration on each new timer for correct fill scaling
- RT/CT strips always rendered; `timer-strip--idle` class dims them when inactive
- Epilepsy Safe Mode hook in place: `[data-epilepsy-safe="true"]` on `#root` disables all pulse animations
- `tagEnd()` now guards `if (name !== captureCtx.tag) return` — fixes nested `<d>` tags breaking exits capture
- Stance indicator tags (`IconSitting`, etc.) now emit both `StanceEvent` and update internal parser state
- Unknown tags inside capture contexts suppressed from debug panel noise

### Milestone 2C — Room Panel, Stream Panels, Experience ✅
> Goal: structured room panel with clickable exits, all stream panels, exp tracker

- [x] PanelFrame — tabbed container, +/× controls, scrollable tab bar
- [x] Room panel — name, desc, objects, players, clickable exits
- [x] Thoughts, Arrivals, Deaths, Active Spells stream panels
- [x] Experience panel — live mindstate tracker with gradient bars, mind-lock badge
- [x] Text preset styling — speech, whisper, thought, roomname, roomdesc, bold, expiry, store
- **Test:** ✅

### Milestone 2D — Smart Scroll Anchor ✅
> Goal: scroll up pauses auto-scroll, badge shows new line count

- [x] Smart scroll anchor — "▼ N new lines" badge, click or End to resume
- **Test:** ✅

---

## Phase 3 — Panel System

### Milestone 3A — Resizable Panel Column ✅
> Goal: right panel column is draggable to resize; width persists across sessions

- [x] Draggable vertical splitter between main text and panel column
- [x] Panel column width persisted to localStorage
- [x] Reset Layout button restores default width
- **Test:** ✅

### Milestone 3B — Three-Zone Right Column ✅
> Goal: right column splits into three independent panel zones with two horizontal splitters

- [x] Panel column split into top (Room), mid (Thoughts), and bottom (empty) zones
- [x] Two horizontal splitters — drag to resize top and mid zones independently
- [x] Top and mid zone heights persisted to localStorage
- [x] Bottom zone takes remaining space (flex: 1)
- [x] Reset Layout resets column width and both zone heights
- [x] Each PanelFrame zone starts with its own independent default tabs
- **Test:** Launch → three zones visible → drag both h-splitters → zones resize → restart → sizes restored

### Milestone 3C — Panel Catalog ✅
> Goal: Familiar, Inventory, and Debug available as panel types in the + menu

- [x] Familiar stream panel (routes `familiar` stream via StreamPanel)
- [x] Inventory stream panel (routes `inv` stream via StreamPanel)
- [x] Debug panel (raw event stream, available as panel type in + menu alongside existing overlay)
- **Test:** ✅ Open + menu → Familiar, Inventory, Debug appear → add Debug → event stream shows live

### Milestone 3D — Panel Manager UI ✅
> Goal: modal listing all panels, open/closed state, move between zones

- [x] Panel Manager accessible from toolbar ("Panels" button)
- [x] Tab state lifted to GameWindow — both zones fully controlled
- [x] Lists all panels with current zone (Top / Bottom / Not Open)
- [x] Move a panel between zones (↑ Top / ↓ Bottom buttons)
- [x] Remove a panel from either zone
- [x] Add closed panels to either zone
- [x] activeId correctly updated on remove
- **Test:** ✅ Open Panels → see all zones → move Room to bottom → Room appears in bottom zone

### Milestone 3E — User-Created Panels ✅
> Goal: players can create named panels on the fly

- [x] "New panel..." option in PanelFrame + menu with inline name input
- [x] Player types a name → custom panel created with unique stream ID
- [x] Custom panels render StreamPanel keyed by their ID
- [x] Empty state shows "Waiting for content on stream X" message
- [x] Custom panels appear in Panel Manager and can be moved/removed
- [x] Lich script streams auto-discovered via pushStream — appear in Panel Manager and + menu automatically
- **Test:** ✅ Click + → New panel... → type name → panel appears with waiting message

### Milestone 3F — Dynamic Stream Discovery & Layout Persistence ✅
> Goal: unknown pushStream IDs auto-populate the panel manager; layout survives disconnect/reconnect

- [x] Parser emits discovery events for unknown pushStream IDs
- [x] GameWindow collects discovered stream IDs into `discoveredStreams` state
- [x] NEVER_DISCOVER filter prevents internal/aliased streams from polluting the list
- [x] Panel Manager "Available Streams" section shows discovered streams with add buttons
- [x] `+` menu in each PanelFrame also shows available discovered streams
- [x] Adding a discovered stream creates a custom tab with the stream ID as key
- [x] `+` menu rendered via React portal — no longer clipped by overflow:hidden ancestors
- [x] `+` menu has max-height with scrollable list + fixed "New panel…" footer
- [x] moonWindow (and similar state-display streams) clear on each push — replace not append (later refactored: REPLACE_ON_PUSH removed; behavior now XML-driven via producer's explicit `<clearStream>` before each push)
- [x] Panel tab layout (all three zones + active IDs) persisted to localStorage
- [x] Reset Layout button resets tabs back to default Room+Thoughts as well as sizes
- [x] Tab close `×` always visible regardless of tab count
- **Test:** ✅ Connect → moonWindow/atmospherics/etc. appear in Available Streams → add one → survives disconnect → Reset Layout restores defaults

---

## Phase 4 — Display, Accessibility & Theming

**Phase 4 — In progress (4A ✅, 4B ✅, 4C ✅, 4D ✅)**

### Milestone 4A — CSS Variables Foundation & Readability ✅
> Goal: extract all hardcoded colors to CSS custom properties; fix readability problems

- [x] `theme.css` created with ~100 named color tokens covering every UI surface
- [x] All CSS files updated to use `var(--...)` throughout — no hardcoded hex colors remain
- [x] Vital bar gradients moved from inline JS strings to CSS classes (`vital-fill--health-ok`, etc.)
- [x] Readability fixes: inactive tab text `#4a4a4a` → `#888`, whisper preset brightened, exp panel secondary text improved, room section labels more visible, panel manager row labels upgraded
- [x] Theme switching now requires only a single `:root` block swap in `theme.css`
- **Test:** ✅ App looks identical to before but all colors are now variable-driven

### Milestone 4B — Base Themes & Theme Picker ✅
> Goal: 5 general themes + theme picker UI in settings

- [x] General base themes: Classic (default), Dark, Darker, Ivory, Mist, Parchment, Slate, Terminal — Ivory (white, indigo accent) and Mist (cool gray, steel blue) added as fully retuned light themes with dark preset colors, halved glow opacities, and brightened vitals gradient starts
- [x] Theme picker UI — list+detail two-panel layout; left column = theme list with dot+name+active badge; right panel = live preview mock (room name/desc/exits/speech) using actual merged theme vars; action buttons below preview
- [x] Live preview on click — no confirmation needed, persists to localStorage
- [x] Guild themes (all 12 guilds including Commoner) — palettes from DESIGN.md Section 6.5; theme list now fully alphabetical in both general and guild categories
- [x] `themes.ts` — `darkBase` + per-theme overrides, `applyTheme`, `initTheme` loaded at startup
- [x] "Theme" button in toolbar opens ThemePicker modal (portal)
- **Test:** Click Theme → pick Parchment → UI goes light → refresh → Parchment still active

### Milestone 4C — Theme Editor & My Themes ✅
> Goal: players can customize and save their own themes

- [x] Three-tab ThemePicker: General | Guild | Custom
- [x] "Customize…" button on every base/guild theme card — always creates a copy, never edits the original
- [x] Theme Editor modal — 5 tabs (Surfaces / Game Text / Vitals / HUD / Room & Exp), all ~90 CSS vars editable with native color pickers, gradient pairs, and rgba fields
- [x] Live preview while editing — changes apply to `:root` immediately (game behind modal is the preview)
- [x] Cancel restores the previously active theme
- [x] Custom tab — shows all My Themes with Edit / Dup / Export / Delete per card
- [x] Duplicate, rename, delete custom themes
- [x] Export theme as JSON file download
- [x] Import theme from JSON file
- [x] Custom themes persisted to localStorage; restored on app startup
- **Test:** Pick Dark → Customize… → change accent to red → Save → Custom tab shows new theme active

### Milestone 4D — Settings Panel & Accessibility ✅
> Goal: settings screen + font config + accessibility toggles

- [x] Settings panel — toolbar button, flat single-level layout, sections for Display and Accessibility
- [x] Font config — family picker (Cascadia Code / Fira Code / JetBrains Mono / Source Code Pro / monospace), size +/- control, line height select; CSS vars `--game-font-size/family/line-height` applied globally
- [x] Large Print mode — bumps game font to 18px, line-height to 1.8, scales `html.style.fontSize` so all `rem` values enlarge proportionally
- [x] High Contrast mode — black bg, white text, yellow accent; overlaid as inline CSS vars on top of active theme
- [x] Color Blind mode — Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia; targeted semantic var overrides (health/indicator/timer/compass colors)
- [x] Epilepsy Safe Mode toggle — sets `data-epilepsy-safe="true"` on `<html>`; CSS `[data-epilepsy-safe="true"]` disables pulse animations
- [x] Vitals bar position toggle — top renders above game-main (full width); bottom renders inside `.text-window-wrap` above command bar (main area width only, stops at panel column divider)
- [x] Theme overlay ordering: re-apply effect in GameWindow re-applies base theme then settings overlays on every settings/theme change so overlays survive theme switches
- [x] Settings persisted to localStorage (`lichborne.settings`); restored on startup via `initSettings()`
- [x] Icon bar position toggle — independent of status bar position (top or bottom)
- [x] Settings reset to defaults button in Settings panel header
- [x] Login screen advanced settings (Lich paths, port, mode, delay, panel open/closed) persisted to localStorage (`lichborne.advancedSettings`)
- [x] Reset Panels moved from toolbar into Panel Manager header; toolbar cleaned up
- [x] Settings button now inherits toolbar theme styling (was missing from CSS selectors)
- [~] Full keyboard navigation — backlogged (see Backlog section)
- [~] Screen reader / ARIA live regions — backlogged (see Backlog section)

## Phase 5 — Quality Pass & Console Polish
*In progress. See DESIGN.md Phase 5 for spec.*

### Phase 5A — Theme & Preset Audit ✅ (in progress)

- [x] Panel resize clipping — mid zone drag capped to column offsetHeight; top zone no longer pushed off screen
- [x] Bold text rendering — renderSegment always sets data-preset on bold elements; `[data-preset="bold"]` CSS now matches
- [x] global.css imports panels.css — preset rules apply across all panels, not just GameWindow
- [x] `<style>` tag redesigned as push/pop marker (was wrongly capture context) — roomname/roomdesc now render correctly in main stream
- [x] Preset id normalized to lowercase on ingest — fixes camelCase `roomName`/`roomDesc` not matching CSS selectors
- [x] `<color fg bg>` inline color tag support — parser stack, TextSegment fg/bg fields, renderSegment inline styles
- [x] `<compass>/<dir>` structured exit parsing — replaces brittle text regex; value="s" format confirmed from live data
- [x] Silent tag cleanup — skin, image, radio, link, switchquickbar, endsetup, resource, exposestream all silenced
- [x] STREAM_MAP additions — room, moonWindow, LichScripts; no more unknown events for known streams
- [x] Stream discovery moved to typed stream-push event — discovery no longer breaks when stream is added to STREAM_MAP
- [x] Parser reset() method — clears all carry-over state on reconnect
- [x] Debug RAW_PROMPT logging removed — was firing an unknown event on every server transaction
- [x] roomname (white) and roomdesc confirmed working in-game via live XML capture
- [x] Preset highlight (background) color — `--preset-*-bg` vars added to all themes (transparent default); theme editor Game Text tab shows symmetric fg+bg rows per preset; panels.css applies background-color; bg hex input always visible, clears to transparent on empty
- [~] Theme preset coverage audit — deferred, all themes inherit from darkBase for now
- [x] Auto-copy on text selection — mouseup listener copies any highlighted text to clipboard in all panels; skips inputs/textareas
- [x] Debug button false-active on login — command input now focused on GameWindow mount; browser no longer lands focus on Debug button
- [x] Stream panel preset coverage — StreamPanel uses renderSegment + panels.css is global; presets apply identically in all stream panels
- [x] Right-click context menu — ContextMenu component (portal, Escape/outside-click to close); "Clear" in main text window and all stream panels; debug panel also gets it alongside existing Clear button; room/exp excluded (structured data, not clearable)
- [x] Text selection styling — ::selection uses color-mix(accent, transparent) so every theme gets a matching tinted highlight automatically; no per-theme overrides needed
- [x] Toolbar/command bar hardcoded dark colors — replaced #181818/#141414 with var(--bg-sunken)/var(--bg-base); Parchment and light themes now render correctly
- [x] Terminology section added to DESIGN.md (Section 2) — Panel / Stream / Structured Panel defined; all sections renumbered
- [x] Stream mapping expansion — `talk`→`conversations`, `combat`→`combat`, `atmospherics`→`atmospherics`, `group`→`group` added to STREAM_MAP; `conversations` added as built-in PanelType with label, renderPanel case, and NEVER_DISCOVER entry
- [x] Stream fallback system — `STREAM_FALLBACK` map + `watchedStreamsRef` (updated on tab changes); all named streams (conversations, thoughts, arrivals, deaths, spells, familiar, combat, atmospherics, group) fall back to main when no panel is open; main window is always the safety net
- [x] Default panel layout updated — Top-Right: Room + Conversations; Center-Right: Thoughts + Arrivals + Deaths + Active Spells; Bottom-Right: Experience + Log; reset-to-defaults block updated to match
- [x] Command bar scoped to main text area — moved inside `.text-window-wrap`; right panel column now extends full window height; bottom-right panel gains the space previously consumed by the full-width input bar
- [x] VitalsBar bottom position scoped to main text area — renders inside `.text-window-wrap` directly above command bar; matches input bar width, stops at panel column divider
- [x] StatusBar renamed to VitalsBar throughout — `VitalsBar.tsx`, `vitalsbar.css`, `vitalsBarPosition` settings key, "Vitals Bar Position" label, all docs updated
- [x] RT/CT timers moved from IconBar into command bar — thin 3px strips (RT=top edge amber, CT=bottom edge blue); `useTimers` hook extracted to `hooks/useTimers.ts`; `cmd-timer` CSS classes in `game.css`; `.command-bar` gets `position:relative; overflow:hidden`; both strips hidden when inactive
- [x] Floating compass — `FloatingCompass.tsx` + `floatingcompass.css`; semi-transparent overlay anchored to bottom-right of game text area; `pointer-events:none`; removed from IconBar
- [x] `.text-area` wrapper — inner `<div className="text-area">` wrapping `.text-window` + floating compass + scroll badge inside `.text-window-wrap`; provides correct `position:relative` context so compass anchors to text area only, not including vitals bar or command bar
- [x] Icon bar redesigned to single row — L hand | R hand | Spell (always visible, shows "None" when idle) | 6 right-anchored status bars; compass and timers removed
- [x] 6 status bars: Bar1=Stance (always active), Bar2=Invisible, Bar3=Webbed, Bar4=Grouped, Bar5=Hidden, Bar6=Bleeding→Stunned→Dead priority; all bars same fixed width; empty bars render placeholder text to maintain consistent size
- [x] VitalUpdateEvent `label` field — `StormFrontParser` extracts custom vital name from `text` attr when `customText='t'` (e.g. Barbarian mana bar sends "inner fire 59%" → stored as "Inner fire"); `vitalLabels` state in GameWindow; `VitalsBar` accepts `labels` prop and prefers server label over default

---

## Phase 6 — Contacts System ✅
*Complete (6A–6C). Full spec in DESIGN.md Section 15.*

### Milestone 6A — Data Model, Templates & Panel UI ✅
> Goal: contacts stored, templates editable, Contacts panel fully functional

- [x] `contacts.ts` — Contact + ContactTemplate types, loadContacts/saveContacts, loadContactTemplates/saveContactTemplates, newContact, newTemplate, formatLastSeen, normalizeTemplate (fills missing fields on old localStorage data), DR_GUILDS array
- [x] Default templates: Friends (#a0d080) and Enemies (#e05050 + "[Enemy]" tag)
- [x] `ContactsPanel.tsx` — portal-rendered modal; Contacts tab with sidebar list + detail form (name, template dropdown with live preview swatch, guild select, circle input, last-seen read-only, notes textarea, delete with confirmation, save); Templates tab with inline expand-to-edit rows
- [x] Template editor fields: name, text color, BG color, bold checkbox, tag text, tag color, tag BG color
- [x] `colorPickerValue()` helper — prevents empty string on `<input type="color">` (avoids console errors from old localStorage data missing new fields)
- [x] Contacts button added to toolbar (`btn-contacts` in `game.css`)
- [x] `contacts.css` — all CSS vars, no hardcoded colors
- **Test:** Open Contacts → create contact → assign Friends template → save → name appears styled in list

### Milestone 6B — Name Highlighting & Tag Injection ✅
> Goal: contact names light up with template colors in all game text panels

- [x] `ContactsContext.tsx` — provides contacts, templates, nameRegex (useMemo), onContactClick to all rendering components
- [x] `renderWithContacts.tsx` — `buildNameRegex(contacts)`: single case-insensitive whole-word alternation RegExp or null; `renderSegmentWithContacts()`: splits TextSegment text around matches, renders tag span (render-only, never modifies underlying data) + styled name span
- [x] `GameWindow.tsx` wired — ContactsContext provider wraps entire render; nameRegex recomputes on contacts change only; `handleContactClick` callback
- [x] `StreamPanel.tsx` wired — uses `useContacts()` hook, passes `onContactClick` to renderSegmentWithContacts
- **Test:** Add "Sekmeht" as Enemy → see "[Enemy] Sekmeht" highlighted in red wherever name appears in game text

### Milestone 6C — Clickable Popover & Last-Seen Tracking ✅
> Goal: click a contact name to see their card; last-seen auto-updates from room

- [x] `ContactPopover.tsx` — portal-rendered, `useLayoutEffect` clamps to viewport, closes on outside mousedown or Escape; shows tag+name header, guild·circle subtitle, last-seen (always visible — "never" if null, "Last seen: X ago — Room" if set), notes, Edit contact button
- [x] `contact-popover.css` — popover styles + `.contact-name--clickable` hover underline
- [x] "Edit contact" in popover opens ContactsPanel with that contact pre-selected (`openContactId` prop)
- [x] Last-seen tracking — `useEffect` on `roomState.players`; scans for contact name matches via nameRegex; debounced 2s localStorage write; updates `lastSeen` timestamp + `lastRoom` from current room name
- [x] Compass "down" → "dn" normalization — `StormFrontParser.ts` normalizes `<dir value="down"/>` to `"dn"` on ingest (server sends "down", FloatingCompass checks for "dn")
- **Test:** Connect → walk into room with a contact → "Also here:" line triggers last-seen update → click name → popover shows correct last-seen and room

---

## Phase 7 — Highlights, Triggers & Macros
*7A complete. Full spec in DESIGN.md Section 14.*

### Phase 7A — Highlights ✅

- [x] `highlights.ts` — `HighlightRule` data model (`id, name, enabled, pattern, mode, caseSensitive, scope, style, priority`); `HighlightStyle` (`textColor, bgColor, bold, glow, glowColor`); `buildHighlightRegex()` with three match modes; `isValidRegex()`; `newHighlight()` factory; localStorage persistence (`lichborne.highlights`)
- [x] Pattern engine — three modes:
  - **Text** — word-by-word `\b` matching joined with `\s+`; handles multi-word phrases and punctuation correctly
  - **Phrase** — exact escaped substring; case-insensitive by default
  - **Regex** — raw user-supplied regex; live error indicator on invalid syntax
- [x] Case sensitivity toggle — `caseSensitive` field on rule; default `true` (case-sensitive); `Aa` button in editor; switches regex between `g` and `gi` flags
- [x] Scope — **Line** (entire `.text-line` div styled via inline style) or **Match** (only matched spans styled); overlap resolution: contacts beat highlights on ties, first match by position wins
- [x] Style per rule — text color, background color, bold, glow (`text-shadow`), glow color (independent picker)
- [x] `HighlightsContext.tsx` — `rules, matchRules, lineRules`; `useCompiledHighlights()` pre-compiles active regexes via `useMemo`
- [x] `renderSegmentFull.tsx` — single-pass renderer replacing `renderSegmentWithContacts`; handles contacts + match-scope highlights in one regex loop; `getLineHighlightStyle()` for line-scope
- [x] Applied in GameWindow main text + all StreamPanels via context
- [x] `HighlightsPanel.tsx` — portal modal; sidebar list (toggle bullet, color swatch, scope badge); detail form with label, pattern field, mode toggle (Text / Phrase / Regex), `Aa` case sensitivity button, Line/Match scope radio, 3-column style grid (Text / Background / Glow with pickers + Bold checkbox), live preview box with custom test input field
- [x] Right-click integration — "Highlight 'word'" (Match scope) and "Highlight this line" (Line scope) in main text context menu; captured line text pre-fills the preview test input
- [x] Highlights toolbar button (`btn-highlights`) wired to theme CSS vars
- [x] `highlights.css` — all `hp-*` panel styles; `.hl-match` in-game span
- [x] **Post-launch bug fixes** — scroll pinning race (useLayoutEffect + overflow-anchor:none); thoughts/arrivals/deaths stream colors (STREAM_DEFAULT_PRESET); mind lock exp panel (nested `<preset>` inside `<component>` no longer steals captureCtx)
- [x] Right-click highlight options added to all stream panels — "Highlight 'word'" and "Highlight this line" threaded through `onHighlight` prop on StreamPanel → PanelFrame → GameWindow's `openHighlightEditor`; captured line text pre-fills the preview
- [ ] Rule import / export (JSON) — deferred
- [ ] Group system (Danger, Alerts, Info, Social) — deferred
- [ ] Highlight Wizard — deferred
- [ ] Panel scope selector (per-rule stream filtering) — deferred

### Phase 7B — Triggers ✅

- [x] `triggers.ts` — `TriggerRule` data model with pattern (Text/Phrase/Regex, case-sensitivity), watch stream scope, AND state gates (health/mana/stamina/spirit/concentration/rt/stance/spell/indicators/room), cooldown, one-shot; 6 action types: Command, Echo, Notify, Sound, Webhook, Variable; `newTrigger`/`newTriggerAction`/`newGate` factories; `buildTriggerRegex`; `interpolate()` with `$var` substitution; `saveTriggers`/`loadTriggers`
- [x] `useTriggerEngine.ts` — React hook; compiled regex ref (recompiles on rule change); per-trigger cooldown timestamps; `processLine(stream, text)` called from GameWindow event loop; `checkGates()` with numeric + string operator comparison; `buildVars()` including named regex capture groups; Web Audio API tone for Sound action; Discord-compatible JSON POST for Webhook action
- [x] Trigger engine wired in `GameWindow.tsx` — `triggerCtxRef` updated synchronously in event loop alongside React state (vitals, rt, stance, spell, indicators, room, hands); `processLine` called for every stream-text event (not room sub-streams or raw); `echoToStream` injects synthetic TextLines into any stream
- [x] `TriggersPanel.tsx` — portal modal; WHEN / THEN / TEST three-section layout; sidebar with enable toggle + action-type emoji badges; pattern + mode + case (same engine as Highlights); watch stream dropdown; AND conditions builder (variable/operator/value chips); cooldown seconds + one-shot checkbox; multi-action card list (add/remove/reorder); per-action type pill selector; `$` variable insertion picker with cursor-aware insert on all interpolatable fields; test mode shows match + variable-substituted action preview
- [x] Action types fully implemented: **Command** (text + optional delay ms), **Echo** (message + stream ID), **Notify** (title + body via Web Notification API), **Sound** (Chime/Alert/Alarm/Ping via Web Audio API), **Webhook** (URL + message → Discord-compatible JSON POST), **Variable** (name + value expression)
- [x] Right-click "Trigger for 'word'" and "Trigger for this line" in main text window and all stream panels — `onTrigger` threaded `GameWindow → PanelFrame → StreamPanel`, mirrors the highlights pattern
- [x] Separate "Triggers" toolbar button; panel styled fully with CSS custom properties, adapts to all themes automatically
- [x] Trigger persistence (`lichborne.triggers`)
- [ ] Rule import / export — deferred
- [ ] Trigger groups — deferred

### Post-7B — UI Quality Pass ✅

- [x] **U01 — Unread tab indicators** — inactive side-panel tabs show a gold dot when new content has arrived; dot clears when the tab is activated; `unreadRef` + `activeIdsRef` in GameWindow drive the logic; no re-render cost on the hot event path
- [x] **U05 — Pending delayed trigger commands cancelled on disconnect** — `useTriggerEngine` now tracks all `setTimeout` handles from delayed Command actions in a `pendingTimersRef` Set; `cancelPending()` exposed from the hook; called immediately on user-initiated disconnect and in the event-handler cleanup on server-side drop
- [x] **U08 — Font preview in Settings** — live preview block added to the Display section of Settings between Line Height and the Accessibility divider; shows room name, plain text, speech, thought, and bold lines styled with the current font family/size/line-height and active theme preset colors; updates instantly on any control change

### Phase 7C — Macros & Aliases ✅

- [x] `macros.ts` — `AliasRule` + `MacroRule` data models; `resolveAlias()` with prefix match + `$1 $2 $rest` argument capture; `resolveMacro()` with key combo matching; `formatKeyCombo()`/`matchKeyCombo()` helpers; `interpolate()` for `$var` substitution; `loadAliases`/`saveAliases`/`loadMacros`/`saveMacros` localStorage persistence
- [x] `MacrosPanel.tsx` — two-tab modal (Aliases / Key Bindings); same sidebar+detail layout as Highlights and Triggers; `KeyBindingField` component with Record button (captures at `capture:true`, Escape to cancel); `CommandList` component with add/remove rows and `$` var-picker (portaled); full CRUD with enable toggle, revert, delete confirmation
- [x] `macros.css` — `ma-*` design language matching `hp-*`/`tp-*` exactly; key badges with `border-bottom: 2px` depth effect; listening pulse animation disabled by `[data-epilepsy-safe="true"]`; tab switcher with count badges in header
- [x] GameWindow wiring — alias resolution intercepts `handleCommand` before send; macros fire from document `onKeyDown` (global, suppressed when any modal is open via `anyModalOpenRef`); `macroTimersRef` tracks delayed command handles cancelled on disconnect; `buildMacroVars()` + `sendCommandSequence()` helpers; `btn-macros` toolbar button between Triggers and Theme

---

## Phase 8 — Automations, Groups & Modes ✅

Full spec in DESIGN.md Section 17.

- [x] `groups.ts` — `RuleGroup`, `GameMode` types; load/save (groups, modes, activeGroupStates, activeModeId); default groups (Combat, PVP, Social, Crafting) + modes (Hunting, PVP, Town, Crafting); `isRuleActive(groupIds, activeGroupStates, allGroups)` predicate
- [x] `GroupsContext.tsx` — React context at App root; `applyModeObject(mode)` added to fix save+apply race; `clearMode` zeros all group states (No Mode = only allGroups rules fire); cleanup effect prunes stale group IDs when groups are deleted
- [x] `GroupPicker.tsx` — reusable chip picker with portal dropdown; shows assigned groups as colored chips with × remove; empty state message when no groups defined
- [x] `ModeSwitcher.tsx` — toolbar popover; shows active mode name with `*` when modified; mode list with hotkeys, No Mode, Manage… link to Groups & Modes tab
- [x] `GroupsModesTab.tsx` — two-panel editor (Groups left, Modes right); mode Apply button uses `applyModeObject(draft)` not `applyMode(id)` to avoid stale-closure race
- [x] `AutomationsPanel.tsx` — unified tabbed modal (Highlights, Triggers, Macros, Aliases, Groups & Modes); hosts each rule editor inline via `inline` prop; accepts prefill props (`highlightPrefill`, `highlightTestText`, `triggerPrefillPattern`) so right-click open-to works
- [x] Inline panel pattern — `inline?: boolean` prop added to HighlightsPanel, TriggersPanel, MacrosPanel; when true renders body only (no backdrop/portal/header); AutomationsPanel provides its own chrome
- [x] `allGroups: boolean` field on all four rule types (`HighlightRule`, `TriggerRule`, `AliasRule`, `MacroRule`) — fires in every mode; defaults `false`; takes priority over `groupIds`
- [x] **All Groups** button in each rule editor — pill toggle with accent fill when active; clears `groupIds` when toggled on; GroupPicker hides when allGroups is on
- [x] Wire Highlights — `useCompiledHighlights` passes `rule.allGroups ?? false` to `isRuleActive`
- [x] Wire Triggers — `useTriggerEngine` passes `rule.allGroups ?? false` to `isRuleActive`
- [x] Wire Macros — macro keydown filter passes `r.allGroups ?? false` to `isRuleActive`
- [x] Wire Aliases — alias resolution filter passes `r.allGroups ?? false` to `isRuleActive`
- [x] Mode hotkeys — GameWindow `onKeyDown` loops `modesRef.current`, matches via `matchKeyCombo`, calls `applyModeRef.current(mode.id)`; fires before macros; suppressed when any modal open
- [x] Toolbar consolidated — `btn-highlights`, `btn-triggers`, `btn-macros` removed; `btn-automations` + ModeSwitcher added
- [x] `automations.css`, `groups.css`, `mode-switcher.css` — full CSS-var coverage, adapts to all themes
- [ ] Trigger `switchMode` action — deferred; `applyMode` available via GroupsContext, only TriggersPanel UI + `useTriggerEngine` executeAction case remain

---

## Bug Fix Pass — Automations & Right-Click ✅

Bugs identified via thorough code audit; all fixed in one pass.

### Right-Click → Automations Prefill

- [x] `openTriggerEditor` was ignoring its `pattern` argument — `setTriggerPrefillPattern` never called; triggers opened with no prefill
- [x] `AutomationsPanel` render in GameWindow was missing all three prefill props (`highlightPrefill`, `highlightTestText`, `triggerPrefillPattern`) — props existed in state but were never forwarded
- [x] `AutomationsPanel` internal tab used `useState(initialTab)` with no sync — already-open modal ignored `automationsTab` changes from GameWindow; right-clicking "Trigger for X" while highlights tab was active did nothing; fixed with `useEffect(() => setTab(initialTab), [initialTab])`
- [x] Both `HighlightsPanel` and `TriggersPanel` prefill `useEffect` used `[]` dependency — second right-click while panel already open would not re-prefill; fixed `HighlightsPanel` to depend on `prefill?.id` and `TriggersPanel` on `prefillPattern`
- [x] Cross-prefill stale state — `openHighlightEditor` didn't clear `triggerPrefillPattern` and vice versa; old prefill could surface on tab switch; each opener now clears the other's prefill state

### Stale Runtime State While Modal Open

- [x] `HighlightsPanel` called `onSaved?.()` on save/delete/toggle but `AutomationsPanel` never passed `onSaved` to `TriggersPanel` or `MacrosPanel` — trigger/alias/macro saves had no path back to refresh GameWindow state
- [x] `TriggersPanel` had no `onSaved` prop at all — added and wired at all three save sites (save, delete, toggleEnabled)
- [x] `MacrosPanel` had no `onSaved` prop at all — added and wired at all six save sites (saveAlias, deleteAlias, toggleAlias, saveMacro, deleteMacro, toggleMacro)
- [x] `AutomationsPanel` now forwards `onSaved` to all four inline panels (Highlights, Triggers, Macros × 2)
- [x] `GameWindow` passes `onSaved` to `AutomationsPanel` that immediately reloads all four rule sets from localStorage — new highlights render, triggers fire, aliases/macros respond without closing and reopening the modal

---

## Debug Panel — Raw XML Tab ✅

- [x] `raw-xml` IPC channel added — main process sends each raw socket line to renderer before parsing
- [x] `onRawXml` exposed on `window.api` via preload bridge
- [x] Debug panel converted to two-tab layout: **Events** (parsed GameEvent stream) and **Raw XML** (raw pre-parse server lines)
- [x] Tab selector in debug toolbar; Clear button clears whichever tab is active
- [x] Each tab maintains independent scroll/pin state — switching tabs does not lose scroll position
- [x] Capped at 500 lines (same as Events); same auto-scroll/pin behavior
- [x] Works both as the toolbar overlay and when Debug is docked as a panel via PanelFrame

---

## XML Parser Audit & Stream Discovery Overhaul ✅

Full audit of live DR login XML against the parser. All items resolved.

### Completed

- [x] **LichScripts stream** — was hardcoded to `'raw'` (discarded); mapping changed to `'LichScripts'`; content now routes and displays correctly
- [x] **`<d cmd='...'>` clickable links** — `d` removed from `SILENT_TAGS`; `linkCmd` state tracked in parser; `cmd?: string` field added to `TextSegment`; renders as dotted-underline clickable spans in all `StreamPanel` instances; clicking sends the command via `onSendCommand`; `</d>` and prompt boundaries clear `linkCmd`; plain `<d>south</d>` (no `cmd`) renders as plain text unchanged
- [x] **Dynamic stream discovery via `<streamWindow>`** — parser now emits `stream-declare` events (new `GameEvent` type) for every non-`main` `<streamWindow>` tag; ID translated via `STREAM_MAP` before emit so `declare` and `push` always use the same target; `title` attribute captured; streams appear in panel manager at login without waiting for first `<pushStream>`
- [x] **Stream titles** — `title` from `<streamWindow>` stored in `streamTitles` state in `GameWindow`; flows through `sharedFrameProps` → `PanelFrame` → `PanelManager`; all panel labels use server-provided title instead of raw ID capitalization
- [x] **`REPLACE_ON_PUSH` removed** — was a client-side hardcode for `moonwindow` only; replace-vs-append behavior is now entirely XML-driven: producers that want replace send `<clearStream>` before each push (moonwatch, script-watch, experience); producers that want append just push; works for all current and future streams without code changes

### Round 2 — Completed (2026-05-06)

- [x] **`<d>TEXT</d>` without `cmd` attr** — bare exit labels (`<d>south</d>`) and help commands (`<d>NEWS NEXT</d>`) now clickable; `linkCmdIsText` flag in parser; first non-empty text node inside a bare `<d>` becomes the command; clicking sends it via `onSendCommand`
- [x] **`<nav/>` added to `SILENT_TAGS`** — movement frame markers no longer emit `unknown` events in Debug panel
- [x] **`room creatures` + `room extra` wired** — both added to `COMPONENT_STREAM`; route to `room-creatures`/`room-extra` stream targets; `RoomState` gains `creatures` + `extra` fields; `GameWindow` handles the new streams; `RoomPanel` shows "Creatures" and "Extra" sections when non-empty
- [x] **Injuries system** — `<dialogData id="injuries">` parsed: 15 body-part `<image>` tags captured per update; `InjuryUpdateEvent` + `InjuryState` + `BodyPartState` types added; `setInjuryState` in `GameWindow`; new `InjuriesPanel` shows wound sections (Head / Torso / Arms / Legs / Other) color-coded by severity (yellow=light, orange=moderate, red=severe); "Injuries" added as a built-in panel type available in Panel Manager

### Round 3 — Completed (2026-05-06)

- [x] **ExpPanel footer** — `exp rexp/tdp/favor/sleep` now displayed in a pinned footer strip below the scrollable skills body; footer shows `TDP # · Fav # · RXP 35m / 4:01h · Resting/Deep Sleep`; sleep level detected from component text ("deep sleep" = level 2, non-empty = level 1, empty = awake); sleep colors use `--exp-sleep-1` (blue) / `--exp-sleep-2` (purple) in `theme.css`; ExpPanel restructured to `exp-panel-body` (scrolls) + `exp-footer` (pinned)

### Open Items (Backlog)

- [ ] **Settings block + metadata tags emit `unknown` events** — `<mode id="GAME"/>`, `<playerID id='...'>`, and ~20 settings block tag types (`settings`, `presets`, `p`, `macros`, `keys`, `k`, `palette`, `i`, `stream`, `w`, `font`, `cmdline`, `strings`, `names`, `ignores`, `vars`, `scripts`, `dialog`, `builtin`, `panels`, `group`, `toggles`, `s`, `misc`, `m`, `display`, `options`, `o`) all hit the `default` case on every login. Fix: bulk-add to `SILENT_TAGS`
- [ ] **`<app char="Agan">` character name discarded** — `app` tag is silenced but carries the logged-in character name. Fix: emit a `char-name` GameEvent from the `app` tag and display character name in the toolbar
- [x] **Room title Simutronics number stripped** — subtitle `[Room Name - NNNN]` had the trailing ` - NNNN` captured as part of the title, breaking map room matching; `StormFrontParser` now strips `/\s*-\s*\d+\s*$/` from bracket content before emitting `room-title`; `roomId` (from `()`) is unaffected
- [ ] **Injury severity encoding unconfirmed** — no wounded XML sample seen yet; severity inferred from numeric suffix in `name` attr (e.g. `"head1"` = light, `"head3"` = severe); verify against actual combat XML and adjust thresholds if the convention differs

---

## Map System — Automapper ✅

Spatially-aware map visualization panel. Renders DragonRealms Lich XML map files as a navigable SVG map with automatic current-room tracking, cross-zone auto-switching, and BFS pathfinding. Inspired by Genie's Automapper; SVG rendering approach is original.

- [x] **`MapZone`, `MapNode`, `MapArc` types** — added to `shared/types.ts`
- [x] **IPC file system bridge** — `browse-folder`, `list-map-dir`, `read-file` channels in `main.ts`; preload bridge + `global.d.ts` declarations
- [x] **XML parser** — browser `DOMParser` in renderer; parses `<zone>`, `<node>`, `<position>`, `<description>`, `<arc>` elements; note-field alias pipe-splitting
- [x] **SVG map canvas** — pan (drag) + zoom (wheel, passive:false imperative listener); fixed-pixel 10×10px square room markers (size = px/scale so rooms stay constant size on screen regardless of zoom); coordinate system uses XML x/y directly — no y-negation (negative y = north = screen-up, matching Genie convention)
- [x] **Arc rendering** — color-coded lines: cardinal (warm tan), vertical (bright gold), special go-exits (sage green), hidden arcs (amber dashed); one-way detection suppresses duplicate bidirectional lines
- [x] **Current room matching** — `findCurrentNode()` matches `node.name` against room title extracted from `[]` in the game subtitle; description compared after whitespace-normalization (lowercase, collapsed spaces) for day/night variant tolerance; name-only fallback for unique names; Simutronics ` - NNNN` suffix stripped in `StormFrontParser` before matching so it never contaminates the title string
- [x] **Cross-zone index** — all XML files in the selected directory are parsed in the background on folder load; `indexing…` indicator in toolbar; auto-switch effect fires when `roomTitle`, `roomDesc`, `zone`, or `indexing` changes — waits for full index before searching so no missed match on fast room transitions; `selectedPathRef` prevents redundant re-loads
- [x] **Label modes** — None / Short (last comma segment) / Full / Alias (note pipe-split) / ID; dropdown in toolbar; persisted to localStorage; applies immediately (in `useMemo` deps)
- [x] **Z-level floor filter** — floor chips (G, +1, -1, All); auto-switches to current room's floor on zone load and room change
- [x] **Room search** — by name or alias; up to 50 results; click result to pan to it; `searchHitIds` drives green highlight on matching nodes
- [x] **BFS pathfinding + auto-walk** — `bfsPath()` over arc graph; double-click a room to start walking; 600 ms/step command timing; path nodes highlighted gold; Stop button in toolbar cancels; timers cleared on unmount and disconnect
- [x] **Room detail panel** — selected room shows name, aliases (from note field), description excerpt, clickable exit direction chips (each sends the move command), Walk here / Stop button with BFS step count
- [x] **Current room indicators** — animated SMIL pulse ring, inner glow border, crosshair dot; green badge `#nodeId` in toolbar when matched, red `?` with debug tooltip (title, desc excerpt, zones indexed) when unmatched
- [x] **Default zoom** — loads at scale 1.8–2.5 centred on current room (if known); fit-all with 0.5 minimum when no room is known
- [x] **Full-screen overlay** — "Maps" toolbar button opens an overlay window (`map-overlay-backdrop` / `map-overlay-window`); Escape/backdrop click closes; same `MapPanel` with `large` prop
- [x] **Panel tab** — `'map'` panel type in `PanelFrame`; embeddable as a tab alongside other panels
- [x] **Toolbar button wiring** — `btn-map` added to shared selector list in `game.css`; `btn-map--active` state matches Debug/Automations style; duplicate definition removed from `map-panel.css`
- [x] **Dot grid background** — subtle 30-unit dot pattern that pans with the map, giving a cartographic chart feel

### Open Items

- [ ] Exit stubs — draw short cardinal-direction stubs from room edge rather than center-to-center lines (Genie visual convention); deferred
- [ ] Multi-file arc destinations — arcs that link across zone files (destination node lives in a different XML file) are not yet followed by the pathfinder
- [ ] Walk delay configurable — 600 ms/step hardcoded; could be a setting

---

## Phase 9 — Packaging & Distribution
*Not started.*

- [ ] Packaged installer (electron-builder)
- [ ] Auto-update

## Backlog

Items removed from active phase scope — too large for current pass, require dedicated planning.

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Full keyboard navigation | Tab through panels, Enter to focus command bar, configurable bindings — touches every component |
| Screen reader / ARIA live regions | Main, room, thoughts panels as live regions; landmark navigation; status bar values as text — requires real screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) |
| HUD widget system | Individual repositionable elements — compass, hands, RT/CT, spell; requires redesign of IconBar/VitalsBar |
| All AI features | Blocked on highlight system (Phase 6) + session capture existing first — see DESIGN.md AI Backlog section |
| Layout Designer | Freeform N×M grid layout system — player defines columns/rows, merges cells, assigns content types (Game Window, streams, Room, Exp, etc.); Game Window cell owns Icon/Vitals/Input bars internally; floating panels as separate OS windows or in-app overlays; snap-to-grid designer mode. Full spec in DESIGN.md Section 12. |
| Multi-Character Support | Inline character tab bar (same toolbar row as Debug/Panels/Theme buttons); each tab shows guild icon + name + health% + status glyphs; full tab state matrix including disconnected with stale state preserved; per-character profiles with encrypted credentials; quick-send overlay (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) to command background characters; pop-out to OS window; per-character layout/theme/history memory. Full spec in DESIGN.md Section 13. |
| Phase 6D — Contact Auto-Detection | Parser detects new player names from arrivals, tells, room players; candidate queue with source context; dismissible add-prompt banner with template picker; session-only ignore list. Deferred — risk of false positives from NPC names/system messages. |
| Trigger switchMode action | `applyMode` wired in GroupsContext; only TriggersPanel action-type UI + `useTriggerEngine` executeAction case remain. Low effort, deferred until trigger polish pass. |

## Notes & Decisions Log

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-04-30 | XML parser will be hand-rolled line classifier — StormFront stream is not well-formed XML, libraries don't fit |
| 2026-04-30 | Phase 2 panels use fixed CSS grid (no dragging) — drag/float/tab added in Phase 3 |
| 2026-04-30 | Session logging deferred to Phase 2 discussion — not starting in 2A |
| 2026-05-01 | Status bar uses flexbox not CSS grid — simpler for a fixed two-row strip, grid reserved for the full panel layout |
| 2026-05-01 | Smart scroll pinning added to both main text window and debug panel — scroll up pauses auto-scroll, within 40px of bottom re-pins |
| 2026-05-01 | RAW_PROMPT debug noise removed from parser |
| 2026-05-01 | Icon bar uses two-row layout: stance/status top, compass/hands/spell bottom — keeps each row uncluttered at any window width |
| 2026-05-01 | RT/CT displayed as persistent thin draining strips at bottom of icon bar — always visible, idle-dimmed; scales to actual timer max not a fixed 10s cap |
| 2026-05-01 | Inactive indicator contrast: #aaa text / #383838 border — readable at all times; active states distinguished by color+glow, not by being the only visible element |
| 2026-05-01 | Vital bars use gradient fills; health has 4-state color thresholds (green ≥80%, yellow 50–80%, orange 30–50%, red <30%) matching Frostbite client approach |
| 2026-05-01 | Status indicators and hand/spell slots use flex:1 to fill full row width at any window size |
| 2026-05-01 | Upgraded two-zone to three-zone right column — top (Room), mid (Thoughts), bottom (flexible) |
| 2026-05-01 | Dynamic stream discovery: parser emits unknown pushStream IDs; GameWindow surfaces them in Panel Manager and + menu |
| 2026-05-01 | NEVER_DISCOVER set filters internal/aliased streams (room sub-streams, logons, percWindow, etc.) from discoverable list |
| 2026-05-01 | + menu rendered via React portal to escape overflow:hidden clipping; menuRef added so outside-click handler doesn't fire on menu items |
| 2026-05-01 | moonWindow uses REPLACE_ON_PUSH — each pushStream clears the stream first so only latest state shows |
| 2026-05-01 | Panel tab layout persisted to localStorage; Reset Layout also resets tabs to Room+Thoughts defaults |
| 2026-05-02 | All colors extracted to CSS custom properties in theme.css — theme swapping is now a single :root block |
| 2026-05-02 | Vital bar gradients moved from inline JS to CSS classes so they are themeable |
| 2026-05-02 | Readability fixes: inactive tab text, whisper preset, exp secondary text, room section labels all improved |
| 2026-05-02 | 17 themes (5 general + 12 guild) defined in themes.ts as CSS-var override objects; applyTheme/initTheme load on startup |
| 2026-05-02 | Guild theme palettes sourced from DESIGN.md Section 6.5 (bg/text/accent per guild) |
| 2026-05-02 | ThemePicker modal: General/Guild tabs, card grid with preview swatches, live apply, portal-rendered |
| 2026-05-02 | Three-tab ThemePicker (General/Guild/Custom); Customize always copies, never edits originals; ThemeEditor with live preview and per-section field types |
| 2026-05-02 | Settings stored in AppSettings; applySettingsToDOM composable overlay — applies after base theme so high contrast/colorblind survive theme changes |
| 2026-05-02 | Large Print scales html.style.fontSize to 16px so all rem values enlarge without touching individual CSS rules |
| 2026-05-02 | Color Blind mode targets only semantic indicator/health/timer vars (not all colors) — avoids breaking theme aesthetics for non-critical UI |
| 2026-05-02 | Vitals bar position conditional render in GameWindow — top renders before game-main (full width); bottom later moved inside text-window-wrap for scoped width |
| 2026-05-02 | Icon bar position is independent from vitals bar position — each has its own setting and conditional render |
| 2026-05-03 | StatusBar renamed to VitalsBar — component, CSS file, settings key (`vitalsBarPosition`), and all docs updated |
| 2026-05-03 | VitalsBar bottom position scoped to main text width — rendered inside `.text-window-wrap` above command bar; right panel column unaffected, bottom-right panel retains full height |
| 2026-05-02 | Login advanced settings grouped into AdvancedSettings interface and persisted to lichborne.advancedSettings; credentials intentionally excluded |
| 2026-05-02 | Reset Panels moved from toolbar button into Panel Manager modal header — toolbar now has Debug, Panels, Theme, Settings, Disconnect only |
| 2026-05-02 | `<style>` tags confirmed as self-closing push/pop markers from live protocol data — DR sends `<style id='roomName'/>` not `<style id='roomName'>text</style>`; parser redesigned accordingly |
| 2026-05-02 | Preset id normalized to lowercase on ingest — server sends `roomName`/`roomDesc` (camelCase), CSS rules use `roomname`/`roomdesc` (lowercase) |
| 2026-05-02 | Compass XML (`<compass><dir value="n"/>`) adopted as authoritative exit source — `value` uses same abbreviations as our internal format; component text exit parsing dropped |
| 2026-05-02 | Stream discovery moved from unknown-event hack (`pushStream:id`) to typed `stream-push` GameEvent — adding a stream to STREAM_MAP no longer silently breaks discovery |
| 2026-05-02 | `<color fg bg>` inline tag support added — parser maintains color stack, segments carry fg/bg hex, renderSegment applies inline style |
| 2026-05-02 | Large batch of Genie UI chrome tags silenced (skin, image, radio, link, switchquickbar, endsetup, resource, exposestream) — confirmed from live XML capture |
| 2026-05-02 | Preset highlight (background) color added — all themes inherit transparent defaults from darkBase; theme editor Game Text tab shows combined fg+bg row; panels.css applies background-color per preset |
| 2026-05-02 | Character profiles feature added to DESIGN.md Section 8 — planned, requires dedicated design session before implementation |
| 2026-05-02 | Preset highlight UX finalized — symmetric swatch+hex pairs for fg and bg; bg always shows `none` placeholder; auto-prepends `#` on type; clearing hex reverts to transparent; no ✕ button needed |
| 2026-05-02 | Auto-copy on text selection — document mouseup listener in GameWindow; skips input/textarea nodes; covers all panels including debug |
| 2026-05-02 | Debug button focus bug — GameWindow now focuses command input on mount; eliminates browser default focus landing on Debug toolbar button |
| 2026-05-02 | Stream panel preset coverage confirmed — StreamPanel uses renderSegment; panels.css global import means all stream panels get preset colors automatically |
| 2026-05-02 | Right-click context menu — shared ContextMenu component (React portal, fixed position); "Clear" wired to main text window, all stream panels, and debug panel; onClearStream threaded through PanelFrame |
| 2026-05-02 | Text selection styling — ::selection { background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 38%, transparent) } in global.css; adapts to all themes automatically |
| 2026-05-02 | Toolbar/command bar hardcoded dark gradients fixed — replaced #181818/#141414 with bg-sunken/bg-base vars; Parchment toolbar now readable |
| 2026-05-02 | `talk` stream mapped to `conversations` (was `raw`/discarded) — Frostbite+Genie research confirmed `talk` is player speech/yell/whisper, not a duplicate of main |
| 2026-05-02 | `combat` stream mapped to its own target (was incorrectly routed to `main`) — combat/atmospherics/group now discoverable dynamic streams |
| 2026-05-02 | Stream fallback system added — all named streams fall back to main when no panel is open (conversations, thoughts, arrivals, deaths, spells, familiar, combat, atmospherics, group); `watchedStreamsRef` tracks open tab IDs and updates on every tab change |
| 2026-05-02 | Default panel layout overhauled — Room+Conversations top-right; Thoughts+Arrivals+Deaths+Spells center-right; Experience bottom-right; chosen based on how frequently each stream fires during normal play |
| 2026-05-03 | Command bar moved inside `.text-window-wrap` — scoped to main text area width only; right panel column now fills full window height giving bottom-right panel maximum vertical space |
| 2026-05-03 | RT/CT moved from icon bar into command bar — Frostbite-inspired thin strips (RT top edge, CT bottom edge); keeps timing info at point of focus without consuming extra layout height |
| 2026-05-03 | Compass made floating overlay in text area bottom-right — semi-transparent, non-interactive, consumes no layout space; `.text-area` wrapper added inside `.text-window-wrap` so compass anchors to text area bounds only |
| 2026-05-03 | Icon bar collapsed to single row: L hand | R hand | Spell (always visible, "None" when idle) | 6 right-anchored status bars |
| 2026-05-03 | 6 status bars replace old stance tile + status indicator set — Bar1=Stance (always), Bars2-5=single conditions, Bar6=Bleeding→Stunned→Dead priority; all bars fixed width, empty bars use placeholder text to prevent size collapse |
| 2026-05-03 | VitalUpdateEvent `label` field added — server sends `customText='t'` + label in `text` attr for guild-specific vital names (e.g. Barbarian mana = "Inner fire"); parser normalizes, GameWindow tracks in `vitalLabels` state, VitalsBar prefers custom label |
| 2026-05-03 | Contacts default templates: Friends + Enemies only (not the full 5 in spec) — kept minimal to avoid clutter; players add their own |
| 2026-05-03 | Tag injection is render-time only — renderSegmentWithContacts produces React spans, underlying TextSegment data never modified; highlights and triggers won't see injected tag text |
| 2026-05-03 | nameRegex compiled via useMemo on contacts change only — single case-insensitive whole-word alternation; not recomputed per line |
| 2026-05-03 | Last-seen tracks roomState.players only (not all game text) — prevents false last-seen updates from names appearing in unrelated context (e.g. someone mentioned in thoughts) |
| 2026-05-03 | ContactPopover always renders last-seen line — "Last seen: never" when null rather than hiding; gives players useful signal that they've never encountered this person |
| 2026-05-03 | Compass bug: server sends `<dir value="down"/>` but FloatingCompass checks for "dn" — normalized in StormFrontParser `case 'dir'` on ingest |
| 2026-05-03 | UI chrome standardization pass — all modals (Contacts, ThemePicker, ThemeEditor, PanelManager) aligned to Settings as gold standard: border-radius 6px, shadow `0 20px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.8)`, backdrop `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`, header padding `12px 16px`, title weight 700/0.9rem, close button 1.4rem with hover transition, section/form labels weight 700 / letter-spacing 1.5px |
| 2026-05-03 | Contacts input focus border: `--accent-bg` → `--accent-dim` to match Settings and ThemeEditor |
| 2026-05-03 | Readability pass on contact popover — last-seen color `--text-dim` → `--text-muted` (3.3:1 → 4.8:1 contrast), room text `--text-faint` → `--text-dim`; contacts form labels `--text-dim` → `--text-muted` |
| 2026-05-03 | All hardcoded danger colors replaced with CSS vars — `#8a2020` → `var(--color-danger-border)`, `rgba(180,40,40,0.15)` → `var(--color-danger-bg)` in contacts.css and panel-manager.css; `rgba(128,128,128,…)` card dividers → `var(--border-faint)` in theme-picker.css |
| 2026-05-03 | Bug fix: `renderWithContacts.tsx` — removed non-null assertion on contacts.find(); now gracefully falls back to plain text render if lookup misses (edge case: whitespace-only name filtered from regex but present in contacts array) |
| 2026-05-03 | Bug fix: `GameWindow.tsx` — added unmount-only cleanup effect to clear `lastSeenTimerRef`; prevents `setContacts` firing on unmounted component if user disconnects within the 2s debounce window |
| 2026-05-03 | Login screen UI polish pass — card widened to 460px; labels updated to "Ruby Path (ruby.exe)" / "Lich Path (lich.rbw)"; all inputs and buttons pinned to 30px height for alignment |
| 2026-05-03 | Port lock added to login screen — `portLocked: true` default; disabled+greyed when locked; 🔒/🔓 toggle; re-locking resets to default port (11024); prevents accidental port corruption |
| 2026-05-03 | Mode lock added to login screen — same padlock pattern as Port; `modeLocked: true` default; re-locking resets to `--stormfront`; Mode is infrastructure, not a player-facing choice |
| 2026-05-03 | Browse buttons added for Ruby Path and Lich Path — IPC handler `browse-file` via `dialog.showOpenDialog`; `.exe` filter for Ruby, `.rbw/.rb` for Lich; exposed on `window.api.browseFile` |
| 2026-05-03 | "Connect via Lich" checkbox moved outside Advanced panel — it is a primary choice, not an infrastructure detail; sits between Character Name and the Advanced toggle |
| 2026-05-03 | Advanced panel collapses by default — `showAdvanced` always overridden to `false` in `loadAdvanced()` so localStorage can never leave it open on next load |
| 2026-05-03 | Visual divider added before Advanced toggle — `border-top: 1px solid #222` separates credential fields from configuration fields |
| 2026-05-03 | Connecting state replaces form — when connecting, form is hidden and only spinner + scrolling status log shown; card stays compact with no layout shift; error restores form for retry |
| 2026-05-03 | login.css intentionally hardcoded — uses fixed hex values, not CSS custom properties; login renders before any character theme is active and must always look consistent |
| 2026-05-03 | Delay/Port/Mode grid columns fixed to `72px 108px 1fr` — Delay tight, Port sized for 5 digits + lock, Mode fills remainder; fixes Mode truncation issue |
| 2026-05-04 | Classic theme added — pure black canvas + WhiteSmoke (#F5F5F5) text; all preset/vital colors sourced directly from Genie's presets.cfg (speech #FFCCB2, whisper #BFFFFF, thought #F9C5F9, roomname #FFDBBF, health red, mana green, etc.); UI chrome lifted above pure-black to maintain panel depth and readable borders |
| 2026-05-04 | Classic set as default theme — `initTheme()` defaults to `'classic'` instead of `'dark'`; Genie veterans see familiar colors immediately on first launch |
| 2026-05-04 | General themes sorted alphabetically — Classic, Dark, Darker, Parchment, Slate, Terminal |
| 2026-05-04 | Vitals bar defaults to bottom position — `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.vitalsBarPosition` changed from `'top'` to `'bottom'`; matches where most players expect it in the DR client layout |
| 2026-05-04 | Log stream panel added as built-in panel type — routes `log` game stream to a dedicated StreamPanel; added to `NEVER_DISCOVER`; included in default bottom-right zone alongside Experience |
| 2026-05-04 | Highlight engine built (Phase 7A) — `HighlightRule` model with Text/Phrase/Regex modes, Line/Match scope, case sensitivity, glow; `renderSegmentFull` single-pass renderer handles contacts + highlights together; line-scope applied at div level, match-scope at span level |
| 2026-05-04 | Text mode uses word-by-word `\b` matching — splits pattern on whitespace, applies `\b` per token, joins with `\s+`; correctly handles multi-word phrases, trailing punctuation, and asterisks without needing Phrase mode |
| 2026-05-04 | Case sensitivity defaults to `true` (case-sensitive) — right-click captures exact game text so exact case is the right default; toggle button `Aa` in editor switches `g`↔`gi` |
| 2026-05-04 | Glow implemented as `text-shadow` — uses dedicated `glowColor` picker (independent from text color); `0 0 6px / 0 0 14px` double-shadow; applied to both match-scope spans and line-scope divs |
| 2026-05-04 | Right-click context menu extended — "Highlight 'word'" (Match scope) and "Highlight this line" (Line scope); captured line text passed as `initialTestText` to preview panel so match is immediately visible |
| 2026-05-04 | `renderSegmentFull` replaces `renderSegmentWithContacts` at all render sites — single regex exec loop collects all contact + highlight match ranges, sorts by position, contacts win ties; no double-pass needed |
| 2026-05-04 | Regex error indicator added — red border + error message on pattern field when Regex mode contains invalid syntax; `isValidRegex()` exported from `highlights.ts` |
| 2026-05-04 | Scroll pinning race fixed — `useEffect` → `useLayoutEffect` for scroll-to-bottom in GameWindow and StreamPanel; fires sync before paint, wins race against Chrome scroll anchoring; `overflow-anchor: none` added to `.text-window` CSS to stop browser competing with our pinning logic |
| 2026-05-04 | Thoughts/Arrivals/Deaths stream colors fixed — parser's `flushSegments()` now auto-assigns a default preset (`thought`/`speech`/`bold`) to unstyled segments in those streams; previously the server sent raw text with no `<preset>` wrapper so `[data-preset="thought"]` CSS never fired |
| 2026-05-04 | Mind lock exp bug fixed — DR server wraps mind lock components in `<preset id='exptraining'>...</preset>` inside `<component>`; parser was overwriting the component's `captureCtx` with the preset's, so the component event was never emitted and 34/34 skills silently disappeared from the exp panel; fix: `<preset>` inside an existing capture context no longer overwrites `captureCtx` |
| 2026-05-04 | Right-click highlight options extended to all stream panels — `onHighlight` prop threaded StreamPanel → PanelFrame → GameWindow; all panels now share identical context menu: "Highlight 'word'", "Highlight this line", "Clear" |
| 2026-05-04 | Trigger system built (Phase 7B) — WHEN→THEN visual model; 6 action types (Command, Echo, Notify, Sound, Webhook, Variable); AND state gates; cooldown + one-shot; `$var` interpolation with cursor-aware picker; no scripting language required |
| 2026-05-04 | Trigger engine uses `triggerCtxRef` updated synchronously in the event loop — triggers always see the current vitals/stance/spell/room within the same event batch, same approach as contacts system for other state |
| 2026-05-04 | Echo action injects synthetic `TextLine` with `preset='echo'` (italic, dim) into any named stream — auto-discovers into the panel system without any extra wiring |
| 2026-05-04 | Triggers panel kept separate from Highlights (own toolbar button) rather than tabbed in same modal — keeps both editors focused and avoids a large combined component; both use identical CSS custom property tokens so theme adaptation is automatic |
| 2026-05-04 | Right-click "Trigger for word/line" added alongside Highlight options in main text window and all stream panels — `onTrigger` prop threaded identically to `onHighlight` |
| 2026-05-04 | Automations/Groups/Modes system designed (not yet built) — Mode = enabledGroups whitelist; Groups = multi-assign color tags; rules get groupIds[]; built-in General group so new rules always run; unified Automations panel replaces separate H/T toolbar buttons; toolbar Mode switcher with modified-state indicator; build after Phase 7C when all four rule systems exist; full spec DESIGN.md Section 17 |
| 2026-05-05 | Theme picker redesigned from card grid to list+detail layout — left column: scrollable theme list (dot + name + ✓ badge); right panel: live preview mock using merged CSS vars; action buttons (Customize… / Edit / Dup / Export / Delete) below preview; fixes Guild tab clipping with 12 themes |
| 2026-05-05 | Bug fix: `<style id='whisper'>` bleeds past `<prompt>` tag — DR server keeps whisper style active across multiple server turns during sanowret crystal knowledge delivery; `StormFrontParser` now clears `currentPreset` when processing a prompt (prompts are frame boundaries; all known styled content is closed before its prompt anyway) |
| 2026-05-05 | Bug fix: `<color>` self-closing form (`<color fg='...'/>`) pushed onto `colorStack` but was never popped — `tagEnd` is never called for self-closing tags, so the color entry leaked into all subsequent text; fixed by skipping the push entirely when `selfClosing=true` |
| 2026-05-05 | Bug fix: `</preset>` nested inside `<component>` never cleared `currentPreset` — `tagEnd` hit the `name !== captureCtx.tag` guard and returned early without resetting the preset set when the nested `<preset>` opened; text between `</component>` and the next prompt inherited the wrong preset (e.g. `exptraining`); fixed by handling `</preset>` inside a foreign capture context as a preset-only clear |
| 2026-05-05 | Bug fix: `colorStack` not cleared on prompt — same structural risk as the `<style>` bleed; orphaned `<color>` entries (from server glitch or Lich script) would accumulate forever; `colorStack` now reset at each prompt alongside `currentPreset` |
| 2026-05-04 | Per-gate AND/OR connectors implemented — each `StateGate` carries its own `connector: 'and' \| 'or'`; `checkGates()` evaluates left-to-right applying each gate's connector to the running boolean; clickable AND/OR pill button between gate rows in editor toggles on click; OR pill highlighted in accent color; removed the earlier global `gateMode` field from `TriggerRule` |
| 2026-05-04 | Trigger `$var` picker portaled to document.body with `position: fixed` — avoids clipping by `.tp-form` overflow-y:auto ancestor; coordinates from `getBoundingClientRect()` at button position; outside-click handler checks both button ref and menu ref |
| 2026-05-05 | Unread tab indicators — `unreadRef` (Set) + `activeIdsRef` (ref of current active tab IDs) added to GameWindow; event handler marks streams unread when their tab is not active; `handleTop/Mid/BottomActive` wrappers clear unread on tab activation; gold dot rendered in PanelFrame on inactive tabs with new content |
| 2026-05-05 | Pending delayed trigger commands now tracked and cancellable — `pendingTimersRef` Set in `useTriggerEngine`; `trackTimer` callback threaded into `executeAction`; `cancelPending()` returned from hook; called on user disconnect and component unmount (server drop); prevents queued commands firing into a dead socket |
| 2026-05-05 | Settings font preview added — five representative game-text lines (room name, plain, speech, thought, bold) in a bordered preview box; font family/size/line-height applied as inline styles from `settings` prop including Large Print override; preset colors from CSS vars so preview respects active theme |
| 2026-05-05 | Bug fix: zero-length match infinite loop in highlight regex loops — typing `^` (or any zero-width assertion) into the highlight pattern field caused the live preview's `while (regex.exec())` loop to spin forever, freezing the renderer thread and crashing it ("Render frame was disposed"); fixed by adding `if (m[0].length === 0) { regex.lastIndex++; continue }` guard in `HighlightsPanel.tsx` (preview loop), `renderSegmentFull.tsx` (match-scope render loop), and `renderSegmentFull.tsx` (contact name loop) |
| 2026-05-05 | Alias system built (Phase 7C) — `resolveAlias()` matches typed input by prefix (not full string); `$1 $2 $rest` capture args after the matched prefix; "hunt" matches "hunt goblin" but not "hunter"; case-insensitive by default; pass-through option also sends original input after alias commands |
| 2026-05-05 | Macro key binding system built (Phase 7C) — `formatKeyCombo()` normalizes keyboard events to "Ctrl+F1" style strings; macros fire from document `onKeyDown` (global, any focus); suppressed via `anyModalOpenRef` when any editor modal is open to prevent firing into form fields |
| 2026-05-05 | KeyBindingField uses `capture: true` event listener during recording — intercepts keydown before any other handler so things like F1 (browser help) and arrow keys are captured cleanly; Escape cancels without recording |
| 2026-05-05 | Macro/alias timer handles tracked in `macroTimersRef` — cleared on disconnect alongside trigger engine's `cancelPending()`; prevents delayed multi-command sequences firing into a dead socket |
| 2026-05-05 | MacrosPanel uses two-tab header (Aliases / Key Bindings) rather than two separate toolbar buttons — keeps all player-input automation in one place; consistent with planned Automations/Groups/Modes unification |
| 2026-05-05 | Automations/Groups/Modes built (Phase 8) — unified Automations panel replacing three toolbar buttons; GroupsProvider at App root so GameWindow can call useGroups(); applyModeObject(draft) added to GroupsContext to avoid save+apply stale-closure race |
| 2026-05-05 | allGroups field chosen over ungrouped-always-fires — deliberate design: rules with no group assignment are silent in all modes, incentivizing categorization; allGroups toggle is the explicit "always fire" escape hatch |
| 2026-05-05 | No Mode zeroes all group states — only allGroups rules fire; switching to No Mode via clearMode() explicitly sets all groups false so no stale state leaks from previous mode |
| 2026-05-05 | isRuleActive signature: (groupIds, activeGroupStates, allGroups) — activeModeId not needed in predicate; all mode-awareness encoded in allGroups flag and activeGroupStates; cleaner than threading activeModeId everywhere |
| 2026-05-05 | Mode hotkeys suppressed when any modal open — same anyModalOpenRef pattern as macros; mode hotkeys checked first (before macros) in onKeyDown to prevent conflicts |
| 2026-05-05 | Inline panel pattern (inline prop) — each panel renders body-only when inline=true, no backdrop/portal/header; AutomationsPanel provides its own chrome; avoids duplicating modal scaffolding |
| 2026-05-05 | Bug fix: right-click → automations prefill path had four separate failures — triggerPrefillPattern never set, props never forwarded to AutomationsPanel, tab state didn't sync when modal already open, useEffect([]) didn't re-run on second right-click; all four fixed independently |
| 2026-05-05 | AutomationsPanel tab sync: useEffect(() => setTab(initialTab), [initialTab]) — GameWindow's automationsTab state is the source of truth; AutomationsPanel mirrors it so right-click always lands on the correct tab regardless of current modal state |
| 2026-05-05 | Prefill effect dependencies: HighlightsPanel depends on prefill?.id, TriggersPanel on prefillPattern — newHighlight/newTrigger always generate fresh UUIDs so each right-click is guaranteed to be a new id and the effect re-fires |
| 2026-05-05 | onSaved propagated to all panels — TriggersPanel and MacrosPanel had no onSaved prop; added to both; AutomationsPanel forwards it to all four inline panels; GameWindow reloads all four rule sets from localStorage on any inline save so live engine state stays current without closing the modal |
| 2026-05-05 | Context menu separators — `ContextMenu` Item type extended to union (action \| separator); items built as three named groups (Highlights, Triggers, Clear), filtered to remove empty ones, joined with `<hr class="ctx-menu-sep">` only between non-empty groups; right-clicking blank space (no word) renders no orphan separators |
| 2026-05-06 | Debug panel gains Raw XML tab — two-tab layout (Events / Raw XML) replaces single-view panel; raw lines sent via dedicated `raw-xml` IPC channel before parsing so the tab shows exactly what the server sent; both tabs auto-scroll and pin independently; Clear button scoped to active tab; docked Debug panel in PanelFrame updated identically |
| 2026-05-06 | LichScripts STREAM_MAP entry changed from `'raw'` (discard) to `'LichScripts'` — `script-watch.lic` periodically pushes running script list; stream is now discoverable and displayable as a panel |
| 2026-05-06 | `<d cmd='...'>` clickable command links implemented — `d` removed from `SILENT_TAGS`; `linkCmd` field in parser tracks active cmd; `cmd` added to `TextSegment`; `renderSegment` renders as `.cmd-link` span when `onSendCommand` provided; prompt and `</d>` both clear `linkCmd`; plain `<d>south</d>` exit labels unaffected (no `cmd` attr) |
| 2026-05-06 | `stream-declare` GameEvent added — emitted from `<streamWindow>` for every non-`main` stream; uses same STREAM_MAP translation as `pushStream` so declared and pushed IDs always match; carries `title` attr; streams discoverable at login without waiting for content |
| 2026-05-06 | Stream titles stored in `streamTitles` Record in GameWindow — sourced from `<streamWindow title='...'>` attr; threaded through `sharedFrameProps` to `PanelFrame` and `PanelManager`; panel labels now use server-provided title (e.g. "Field Experience", "Active Spells") instead of raw stream ID capitalization |
| 2026-05-06 | `REPLACE_ON_PUSH` hardcode removed — was client-side workaround for `moonwindow` only; replace-vs-append is now fully XML-driven via explicit `<clearStream>` from producers; works generically for all current and future streams |
| 2026-05-06 | `<d>TEXT</d>` bare form now clickable — `linkCmdIsText` flag set when `<d>` has no `cmd` attr; first non-empty text node becomes the command; covers exit labels in main text stream (`<d>south</d>`), help commands (`<d>NEWS NEXT</d>`), and any other bare `<d>` the server sends |
| 2026-05-06 | `<nav/>` silenced — movement frame marker added to `SILENT_TAGS`; was flooding Debug with unknown events on every room transition |
| 2026-05-06 | `room creatures` + `room extra` fully wired — added to `COMPONENT_STREAM` targeting `room-creatures`/`room-extra`; `RoomState` gains `creatures` and `extra` fields; `GameWindow` handles clear and update for both; `RoomPanel` renders conditional "Creatures" and "Extra" sections |
| 2026-05-06 | Injuries panel added — `<dialogData id="injuries">` arrives every ~60 s with 15 body-part `<image>` elements; `image` removed from `SILENT_TAGS` and gets its own switch case; `inInjuriesDialog` flag batches parts until `</dialogData>`; `InjuryState` stored in `GameWindow` and threaded to `PanelFrame`; `InjuriesPanel` shows only wounded parts grouped by body section (Head/Torso/Arms/Legs/Other) with yellow/orange/red severity; severity derived from numeric suffix in `name` attr — awaiting combat XML sample to confirm convention |
| 2026-05-06 | ExpPanel footer added — `exp rexp/tdp/favor/sleep` components displayed in a pinned strip below the scrollable skills list; `ExpPanel` restructured to `exp-panel-body` (flex:1, overflow-y:auto) + `exp-footer` (flex-shrink:0, pinned); footer always visible regardless of scroll position |
| 2026-05-06 | RXP display format: `RXP 35m / 4:01h` — usable-this-cycle (minutes) shown first as the actionable number, stored hours second; cycle refresh time omitted from display (least actionable of the three values) |
| 2026-05-06 | Sleep level detected from `exp sleep` component text — empty = awake (nothing shown); contains "state of rest" but not "deep sleep" = level 1 (`Resting`, blue `--exp-sleep-1`); contains "deep sleep" = level 2 (`Deep Sleep`, purple `--exp-sleep-2`); colors defined as CSS vars in `theme.css` alongside other exp vars |
| 2026-05-06 | Footer CSS: values use `--text-muted` (#888), labels use `--text-dim` (#666) — label recedes, value reads forward; same contrast pattern used throughout exp panel rows; `white-space: nowrap` + `overflow: hidden` keeps footer on one line at all panel widths |
| 2026-05-06 | RT/CT chip style redesigned — switched from CSS grid (1fr stretching) to flex with fixed 8×6px chips and 6px gap; chips stack left-to-right from input edge, rightmost chips disappear as time counts down; overflow-hidden on wrapper clips very long RTs naturally |
| 2026-05-06 | RT/CT bar style updated to match chip visual treatment — solid `var(--rt-end)` / `var(--ct-end)` color (no gradient, no glow), 6px height matching chip height |
| 2026-05-06 | Chip/bar pulse animation tuned — brightness dims to 0.85 (was 0.4, then 0.7); subtle flicker that keeps hue without going dark |
| 2026-05-06 | Settings: RT/CT Timer Style toggle — Chips (default) or Bar; chips preferred as default for visual clarity |
| 2026-05-06 | ExpPanel section order: Mind Locked now renders above Learning — locked skills are higher-priority information during active play; both sections retain their existing collapsed/expanded defaults |
| 2026-05-06 | Window title bar shows character identity — parser handles `<app char="Agan" game="DR"/>` sent at login and emits `PlayerInfoEvent`; `GameWindow` sets `document.title` to `"CharName · GAME — Lichborne"`; before connect the title remains `"Lichborne — DragonRealms"` (set in `main.ts` at window creation); essential for distinguishing multiple instances running different characters |
| 2026-05-07 | Version display: `__APP_VERSION__` injected at build time via Vite `define` from `package.json`; shown on login screen below subtitle (`.login-version`, dimmer/smaller) and appended to window title in both pre-login (`Lichborne vX.Y.Z — DragonRealms`) and post-login (`CharName · GAME — Lichborne vX.Y.Z`) states |
| 2026-05-07 | Application menu: custom `Menu.buildFromTemplate` replaces Electron default; File (Open Data Folder via `app.getPath('userData')`, Quit) + standard Edit/View/Window roles preserved; `shell.openPath` opens folder in OS file explorer regardless of OS/user profile |
| 2026-05-07 | DevTools auto-open gated on `!app.isPackaged` — opens automatically in dev, stays closed in portable builds; still accessible via View → Toggle Developer Tools |
| 2026-05-07 | Versioning convention: `0.1.x` = bug fixes/polish, `0.2.0` = next feature batch, `1.0.0` = stable public release |
| 2026-05-07 | Packaging: portable exe chosen over NSIS installer — no code signing (SmartScreen warning accepted for small test group); `release/` added to `.gitignore`; `npm run dist` builds locally via electron-builder; `node publish.mjs` publishes to GitHub Releases with release notes attached; `latest.yml` generated alongside exe for updater version checks |
| 2026-05-07 | Release notes: `releaseInfo.releaseNotesFile` in electron-builder config is unreliable — switched to `publish.mjs` which uses the programmatic `build()` API and then PATCHes the GitHub release body directly via the REST API; this guarantees notes appear regardless of electron-builder internals |
| 2026-05-07 | `latest.yml` missing from releases: partial `config.publish` override in `publish.mjs` was stripping `provider`/`owner`/`repo`; fixed by moving `releaseType: draft` into `package.json` publish block and removing the override from `publish.mjs` |
| 2026-05-08 | `latest.yml` not generated by electron-builder for portable target — fixed by generating it manually in `publish.mjs` using SHA-512 hash of the output exe and uploading via GitHub REST API; also fixed stale exe bug by filtering `release/` directory by current version string so old leftover exes are ignored |
| 2026-05-07 | Version number stale in packaged exe: `publish.mjs` was calling electron-builder `build()` directly without rebuilding first — it packaged the old `dist/` output; fixed by running `execSync('npm run build')` at the start of `publish.mjs` so `__APP_VERSION__` and `app.getVersion()` always reflect the current `package.json` version |
| 2026-05-07 | Login card resize bug: card had `max-height` but no `min-height`, causing it to shrink when switching from form to connecting state; fixed with `min-height: 460px` on `.login-card` and `min-height: 300px` + `justify-content: center` on `.connecting-state` |
| 2026-05-07 | Lich auto-detect: button-triggered only (not on panel open) — avoids surprising path overwrites; main process handler uses `process.platform === 'win32'` guard so Linux/Mac get nulls; version dirs sorted numerically so `4.0.11 > 4.0.3`; returns full validity state so renderer can show per-path ✓/✕ icons |
| 2026-05-07 | Direct connection advanced panel: was showing empty black box when `useLich` false; replaced with `.advanced-direct-note` message "No advanced settings for connecting directly." |
| 2026-05-07 | Auto-update: `electron-updater` checks GitHub Releases 3s after launch (production only — `app.isPackaged` guard); `autoDownload: false` so user controls timing; renderer shows green banner with Download → Downloading… → Restart & Install flow; banner lives in `App.tsx` so it appears on both login and game screens |
| 2026-05-08 | Auto-updater silent failure root cause: `app-update.yml` not generated by electron-builder for portable builds; fixed by creating it manually in `build/` and bundling via `extraResources` in package.json |
| 2026-05-08 | Artifact name mismatch: default name used spaces (`Lichborne 0.1.4.exe`) but GitHub serves assets with hyphens; fixed with explicit `artifactName: "${productName}-${version}.exe"` in win build config |
| 2026-05-08 | Auto-updater logs forwarded to DevTools console via `updater-log` IPC channel — errors, checking, and no-update states all visible in renderer DevTools without needing a terminal |
| 2026-05-08 | Update banner made dismissable — ✕ button on right; dismissed state resets when a new update is detected or when download completes; allows players to safely log out before installing |
| 2026-05-08 | System font picker — replaced hardcoded 4-option font `<select>` with full system font enumeration via Local Font Access API (`window.queryLocalFonts()`); main process grants `local-fonts` permission via both `setPermissionRequestHandler` and `setPermissionCheckHandler` (both required — check handler is the synchronous pre-check Chromium does before fulfilling the API call); fonts deduplicated by family, sorted alphabetically; UI is an inline scrollable list (~7 items visible) with a live filter input above it; selected font highlighted in accent color and auto-scrolled into view on open; `fontFamily` setting now stores raw font name; `applySettingsToDOM` falls back to `'FontName', monospace` for raw names, legacy preset keys still resolve to full fallback stacks; legacy keys transparently migrated to font names on first Settings open |
| 2026-05-08 | B16 fix — scroll-pinning secondary race: `pinnedRef` was updated by the async `onScroll` DOM event; game lines arriving before that event fired caused `useLayoutEffect` to see a stale `true` and auto-scroll even while user was scrolled up (badge still incremented correctly, scroll also happened). Fix: `GameWindow` re-reads scroll position from the DOM right before `setLines` so `pinnedRef` is always current at the moment the layout effect checks it; `StreamPanel` snapshots scroll position during the render phase (before React commits new lines) for the same guarantee. |
| 2026-05-08 | Check for Updates button added — shown only on login screen; subtle muted style; shows "Checking…" while in flight; shows "You're up to date" after a no-update response; hides when update banner takes over |
| 2026-05-08 | Release folder cleanup added to `publish.mjs` — deletes all `.exe` and `.yml` files from `release/` before each build so stale files from prior runs can never pollute the `latest.yml` filename lookup |
| 2026-05-08 | B04 fix — `<output class="mono"/>` / `<output class=""/>` tags now handled in StormFrontParser; `monoMode` state toggles on/off; lines emitted in mono mode carry `mono: true` on `StreamTextEvent` and `TextLine`; both main window and panel renderer apply `white-space: pre` to mono lines, preserving the server's fixed-width column spacing for stat displays |
| 2026-05-08 | B06 fix — ExpBrief mode (`EXPBRIEF ON`) omits mindstate names from `<component id='exp ...'>` updates and sends only `[x/34]` bracket notation; `parseExp` in ExpPanel now falls back to parsing the bracket index (e.g. `[16/34]` → mindstateIdx 16) when no mindstate string is present; handles `[ 7/34]` with leading space and `(x/34)` parenthesis form; normal mode continues working via string matching unchanged |
| 2026-05-08 | B01 fix — `<a href='...'>text</a>` tags now parsed in StormFrontParser; `href` and `autoHref` properties added to `TextSegment`; links render as `.url-link` spans that call `shell.openExternal` via IPC; `<LaunchURL src='...'>` tag handled — constructs full URL and fires `launch-url` event intercepted in main.ts before reaching renderer; bare `http://`/`https://` URLs in plain game text auto-detected via static regex with trailing-punctuation stripping; `autoLinkUrls` toggle in Settings (default on); `--link-color` and `--cmd-link-color` CSS variables added to all themes and ThemeEditor; F04 `<d cmd>` flag links verified working in main window |
| 2026-05-08 | B03 fix — keyboard scroll keys wired up in main text window: PageUp/PageDown scroll by one screen, Home jumps to top of history, End returns to bottom and re-pins auto-scroll; all suppressed when command input is focused; scrollbar arrow buttons added via `::-webkit-scrollbar-button` with SVG data-URI triangles (width widened to 12px to accommodate); hover darkens button background |
| 2026-05-06 | Per-stream timestamps — right-click any stream panel to toggle `[HH:MM]` prefix; `timestamp: number` stored on every `TextLine` at receive time; display controlled by `streamTimestamps` Record in `GameWindow` persisted to localStorage; toggling applies retroactively to all buffered lines; `.ts-prefix` span styled muted/dim, non-selectable; applies to all stream panels including custom/discovered streams |
