## What's new in v0.3.2

### Injuries panel — wounds now display correctly

- **Injuries panel now shows your wounds** — the panel was showing "No active wounds." even when you had wounds. The game sends `height="0" width="0"` on all body-part elements regardless of injury status; the actual wound signal is the `name` attribute (`Injury1`, `Injury2`, `Injury3` for light/moderate/severe, or the part name when healthy). The wound detector was checking height/width and always returning zero. Fixed — injuries display and color-code correctly by severity.

### Login — remember your password

- **Password saved per account** — a "Remember password" checkbox on the login screen saves your password encrypted with Windows DPAPI (`safeStorage`). When you type an account name that has a saved password, the field fills automatically. The password is only saved after a successful connection, and cleared if you uncheck the box.

### Themes — improved contrast and full CSS var coverage

- **Text is easier to read across all themes** — several darkBase color values were too close to their backgrounds: `--text-dim`, `--text-faint`, `--compass-center-text`, `--hand-label-color`, `--room-section-color`, `--exp-rate-color`, and map muted text. The `--border-faint` value was literally identical to `--bg-base` (#1a1a1a), making structural borders invisible. All lifted to legible values. The `classic` theme compass inactive and center text were near-invisible on their near-black background and have been corrected.
- **All guild themes** have their map muted-text color raised to approximately 3:1 contrast on the respective map background (was as low as 1.6:1 in some themes).
- **Bold text is now yellow across all dark themes** — `<bold>` text (monster names, bold combat lines) now renders as bright yellow (#ffff00) in all dark themes (Dark, Darker, Classic, and all guild themes), matching the traditional Genie experience. Light themes (Ivory, Mist, Parchment) and Terminal are unchanged.
- **Hardcoded colors removed from CSS** — injury severity colors, the exp footer sting/sleep indicators, the debug active button, scroll-anchor badge states, disconnect/login button states, and the update banner are all now driven by CSS custom properties and `color-mix()`, so they respond correctly to every theme including light themes (Ivory, Mist, Parchment) and custom themes.

### Parser — bold state no longer bleeds across sessions

- **Yellow text after Lich script output fixed** — if a Lich script sent text containing a literal `<` (e.g. `health: 60 < 65`) wrapped in `<pushBold/>`, the tokenizer would misparse `< 65<popBold/>` as a single malformed tag and silently swallow the closing `<popBold/>`. This left `boldDepth` stuck at 1 for the rest of the session, making all subsequent text appear bold — which the dark theme renders yellow. Fix: `boldDepth` is now reset to 0 at each `<prompt>` boundary. Prompts are frame boundaries in the DR protocol and bold cannot legitimately survive one.
- **Style state no longer carries into a new session** — `parser.reset()` is now called when initiating a new login, so a stuck `boldDepth`, orphaned color stack, or any other parser state from the previous session cannot bleed into the new one.

### Login — Lich settings sync to second windows

- **Advanced settings no longer reset to defaults in new windows** — Lich path, Ruby path, port, and other advanced fields now write to the shared profile YAML whenever you change them on the login screen, not just after a successful connection. A second window opening concurrently reads the YAML and picks up your current settings instead of falling back to defaults.

### Import wizard — Wrayth strings row no longer duplicated

- **Duplicate "Substitution rules" row removed from Wrayth import** — the Wrayth parser was setting both `stringsCount` (shown as "Wrayth strings") and `substitutionCount` (shown as "Substitution rules") from the same `<strings>` block data, producing two rows for the same content in the Step 3 summary. The spurious `substitutionCount` assignment has been removed; only the "Wrayth strings" row appears now.

## What's new in v0.3.1

### Map — room matching fixes

- **Map now follows you reliably** — room matching completely reworked. The client extracts your Lich room ID directly from the game subtitle and does a direct lookup, so the current room indicator lights up correctly even in areas where multiple rooms share the same name (like "Abandoned Road")
- **Genie graph matching improved** — Genie nodes that were showing as unmatched orphans despite being mapped in Lich (like "Bulk Materials" in Leth Deriel) now match correctly. The matcher tries the full zone-qualified title as a fallback when the short name alone doesn't match
- **Better mismatch messages** — when a room can't be found in the Lich map, the banner now says "Lich #NNNN not in map" when the game sent a room ID, so you know the room exists but isn't mapped yet

### Map — graph view improvements

- **Cross-zone exits in the detail panel** — rooms with a ◆ diamond now show which zone they connect to. Click the exit command (e.g. `go meeting portal`) to walk there, or click the zone name to browse that zone in the graph without walking
- **Detail panel stays current as you move** — once you open the detail panel by clicking a room, it follows you as you move rather than staying locked on the room you first clicked
- **Cleaner detail panel** — room name is no longer buried in the full zone-qualified title; zone shows as a small badge beside it. Genie coordinates moved to a tooltip on the room ID. "You are here" indicator sits inline in the header
- **◆ Recenter works from any zone** — if you've browsed to a different zone and press ◆, it now switches back to your actual zone and centers on you rather than jumping to the wrong position
- **↺ Reload button** — reloads the Lich map database on demand. Useful after Lich maps a new room — no restart needed
- **Auto-reload on map download** — when `repository.lic` downloads a new map database, Lichborne detects it and reloads automatically

### Map — bug fixes

- **Mouse wheel zoom fixed** — scroll wheel now works in the Graph view immediately after the panel loads
- **Map controls no longer break zoom** — clicking the fit, zoom, center, or floor buttons no longer disrupts mouse wheel zoom
- **Single center button** — the duplicate ◆ Re-center button in the Graph toolbar has been removed
